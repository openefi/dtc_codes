{"code":"P3495","description":"Cylinder 12 Exhaust Valve Control Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Peugeot, Jeep, Chevrolet, Chrysler, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and engine configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P3495 and related codes P3493, P3494 and P3496 are associated with the cylinder 12 exhaust valve control circuit.","The purpose of the cylinder 12 exhaust valve control circuit is to turn off the exhaust valve to accommodate the cylinder deactivation feature (e.g. V4 mode of a V8 engine) to improve fuel economy during light load operation at idle or on the highway. The Engine Control Module (ECM) controls the 4 or 8 cylinder modes of the engine deactivating four of the engine cylinders. This process is accomplished by incorporating variable valve timing solenoids that turn the exhaust valves on and off as required. This code pertains to the number 12 cylinder and the other three cylinders in this process are determined by the engine configuration and the firing order of the cylinders. The ECM will limit cylinder deactivation to a cycle time of 10 minutes in V4 mode, and then return to V8 mode for 1 minute. The number 12 cylinder variable valve timing solenoid is mounted on or near the exhaust manifold in the vicinity of that cylinder based of the specific configuration and vehicle.","When the ECM detects voltage or resistance within the cylinder 12 exhaust valve control circuit, that is too low, below the normal range threshold, code P3495 will be set and the check engine light, service engine soon light or both may be illuminated. In some circumstances, the ECM may disable the injector to the number 12 cylinder until the issue is corrected and the code has been cleared causing a noticeable engine misfire.","Cylinder Deactivation Solenoids:\n"],"symptoms":["Increased fuel consumption\nPoor engine performance\nEngine misfire\nService engine soon light illuminated\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Faulty variable valve timing solenoid\nLow engine oil level or pressure\nRestricted oil passage\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nCorroded, damaged or loose connector\nDefective ECM"]}
