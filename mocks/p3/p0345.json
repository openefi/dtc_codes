{"code":"P0345","description":"Camshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Malfunction (Bank 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model.","This indicates that a problem was detected in the camshaft position sensor circuit of bank 2.","\nÂ ","Since it says circuit, that means the problem could lie in any part of the circuit - the sensor itself, the wiring, or the PCM. Don't just replace the CPS (camshaft position sensor) and think that will definitely fix it."],"symptoms":["Hard starting or no start\nRough running / misfiring\nLoss of engine power"],"causes":["A code P0345 could mean one or more of the following has happened:","a wire or connector in the circuit could be grounded/shorted/broken\nthe camshaft position sensor may have failed\nthe PCM may have failed\nthere exists an open circuit\nthe crankshaft position sensor may have failed"],"type":"ERR"}
