{"code":"P0327","description":"Knock Sensor 1 Circuit Low Input (Bank 1 or Single Sensor)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A knock sensor tells the engine computer when one or more of your engine's cylinders are \"knocking\", that is, exploding the air/fuel mixture in a way that delivers less power and can be damaging to the engine if prolonged.","The computer uses this information to tune the engine so that it doesn't knock. If your knock sensor on Bank #1 is generating a low output voltage (perhaps under 0.5V), then it will trigger a P0327 DTC. This P0327 code may show up intermittently or the Service Engine light may be lit constantly. Other knock sensor related DTC codes include P0325, P0326, P0328, P0329, P0330, P0331, P0332, P0333, and P0334.","\nÂ "],"symptoms":["You may notice drivability problems including fluctation engine RPM, a loss of power, and perhaps some hesitation. There may also be other symptoms."],"causes":["Potential causes for a P0327 DTC include (but are not limited to):","The knock sensor is faulty and needs to be replaced\nThere is a wiring open/short/fault in the knock sensor circuit\nThe PCM/ECM has failed"],"type":"WARN"}
