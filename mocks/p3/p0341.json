{"code":"P0341","description":"Camshaft Position Sensor Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","This P0341 code basically means that the powertrain control module (PCM) detected a problem with the camshaft signal.","\nÂ ","The camshaft position sensor (CPS) sends a specific signal to the PCM for Top Dead Center on the compression stroke as well as signals indicating the position of the cam sensor. This is accomplished through a reluctor wheel attached to the camshaft that passes by the cam sensor. Any time that the signal to the PCM is inconsistent with what the signal should be, this code is set. NOTE: this code can also be set by extended cranking periods."],"symptoms":["The car will likely run with this code set, as it is often intermittent and also because the PCM can often operate the vehicle in \"limp-in/limp-home\" mode even with a cam sensor signal problem. There may be no noticeable symptoms other than:","Poor fuel economy (if engine runs)\nPossible no start condition"],"causes":["A code P0341 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Cam sensor wiring routed too close to spark plug wiring (causing interference)\nPoor wiring connection at cam sensor\nPoor wiring connection at PCM\nBad cam sensor\nDamaged reluctor wheel"],"type":"ERR"}
