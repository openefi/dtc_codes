{"code":"P0359","description":"Ignition Coil I Primary/Secondary Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The COP (coil on plug) ignition system is what is used on most modern engines. There is an individual coil for each cylinder that is controlled by the PCM (powertrain control module).","\nÂ ","It eliminates the need for spark plug wires by putting the coil right above the sparkplug. Two wires are dedicated to each coil. One is a battery feed usually from the power distribution center. The other wire is the coil driver circuit from the PCM. The PCM grounds/ungrounds this circuit to activate or deactivate the coil. The coil driver circuit is monitored by the PCM for faults","If an open or a short is detected in the driver circuit for coil #9, a P0359 may set. Also, depending on the vehicle, the PCM may also shut down the fuel injector to the cylinder also."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nEngine misfire may be present or intermittent"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0359 code include:","Short to voltage or ground on COP driver circuit\nOpen on COP driver circuit\nLoose connection at coil or broken connector locks\nBad Coil (COP)\nFaulty Powertrain Control Module"],"type":"ERR"}
