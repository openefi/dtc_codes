{"code":"P0366","description":"Camshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Range/Performance Bank 1","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC), which means it covers all makes/models from 1996 and newer. Specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","This P0366 code basically means that the powertrain control module (PCM) detected a problem with the \"B\" camshaft signal. This DTC pertains to engine bank 1, which is the bank of cylinders that contains cylinder #1.","\nÂ ","The camshaft position sensor (CPS) sends a specific signal to the PCM for Top Dead Center on the compression stroke as well as signals indicating the position of the cam sensor. This is accomplished through a reluctor wheel attached to the camshaft that passes by the cam sensor. Any time that the signal to the PCM is inconsistent with what the signal should be, this code is set. NOTE: this code can also be set by extended cranking periods."],"symptoms":["The car will likely run with this code set, as it is often intermittent and also because the PCM can often operate the vehicle in \"limp-in/limp-home\" mode even with a cam sensor signal problem. There may be no noticeable symptoms other than:","Poor fuel economy (if engine runs)\nPossible no start condition\nCheck engine light on"],"causes":["A code P0366 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Cam sensor wiring routed too close to spark plug wiring (causing interference)\nPoor wiring connection at cam sensor\nPoor wiring connection at PCM\nBad cam sensor \"B\" on bank 1\nDamaged reluctor wheel"],"type":"ERR"}
