{"code":"P0314","description":"Single Cylinder Misfire (Cylinder not Specified)","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to most manufacturers since 1996.","Those manufacturers include but are not limited to GM, Ford, Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Volvo and VW.","\nÂ ","This code is focused on the relationship between the crankshaft position sensor (CKP), the camshaft position sensor (CMP) and the engine controller (ECM/PCM). The PCM monitors the relationship between these two sensors and compares them to an ideal reference stored in the PCM. If the variation exceeds a calibrated percentage, a fault code is stored. This can be either an electrical fault or a mechanical issue, depending upon the reason for the misfire and the vehicle manufacturer.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer and the type of crankshaft position sensor (CKP), camshaft position sensor (CMP) and their wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) on\nMisfire / bucking or surging\nBelow normal fuel economy"],"causes":["Typically, the causes for this code to set are:","Most Common Issues:","Worn ignition system components, to include the coil, plug wires, spark plugs, etc.\nFuel system components - to include the injectors","Least likely:","Intermittent open in the power, ground or signal circuit to the crankshaft position sensor\nIntermittent open in the power, ground or signal circuit to the camshaft position sensor\nFailed PCM - rarely"],"type":"ERR"}
