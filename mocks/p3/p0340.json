{"code":"P0340","description":"Camshaft Position Sensor Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. So this engine code article applies to Nissan, Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Dodge, Honda, GMC, etc.","This P0340 code indicates that a problem was detected in the camshaft position sensor circuit.","\nÂ ","Since it says circuit, that means the problem could lie in any part of the circuit - the sensor itself, the wiring, or the PCM. Don't just replace the CPS (camshaft position sensor) and think that will definitely fix it."],"symptoms":["Hard starting or no start\nRough running / misfiring\nLoss of engine power"],"causes":["A code P0340 could mean one or more of the following has happened:","a wire or connector in the circuit could be grounded/shorted/broken\nthe camshaft position sensor may have failed\nthe PCM may have failed\nthere exists an open circuit\nthe crankshaft position sensor may have failed"],"type":"ERR"}
