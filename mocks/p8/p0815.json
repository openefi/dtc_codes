{"code":"P0815","description":"Upshift Switch Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Acura, Vauxhall, Aston-Martin, Mercedes-Benz, Sprinter, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0815, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the upshift switch circuit. This type of code is usually limited to vehicles with paddle shifters.","The transmission control module (TCM) may be a stand alone module or part of the PCM. Upshift (paddle) shifter buttons are typically located on the steering wheel horn pad in close proximity to the driver’s finger position. They are used as a type of sport shifter, usually in high-performance models. The PCM monitors transmission gear selection in comparison to upshift switch input signals to ensure continuity. Additionally, the PCM monitors upshift switch circuit voltage to ensure that is within established parameters.","If the PCM detects that the transmission gear selection is not conducive to the gear selection signal input by the upshift switch or if switch circuit voltage is not within allowable parameters, a code P0815 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Manual (paddle) upshift function disabled\nShift indicator reflects incorrect gear\nNo symptoms may be exhibited"],"causes":["Defective upshift switch\nShorted or open circuits in upshift switch circuit\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
