{"code":"P0801","description":"Reverse Inhibit Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Subaru, Dodge, Buick, Cadillac, Peugeot, Chevrolet,Toyota, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0801, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the reverse inhibit control circuit. A P0801 may pertain to either the transmission or transfer case, depending upon vehicle make and model.","The transmission control module (TCM) or transfer case control module (TSCM) may be a stand alone unit but is most commonly integrated into a single housing with the engine control module (ECM). This is called the PCM.","The PCM utilizes input signals from multiple engine and transmission sensors to calculate automatic transmission shift strategy. The reverse inhibit switch is designed to prevent the transmission from being shifted into reverse while the vehicle is proceeding in a forward direction. Typically, an electronically controlled solenoid is responsible for actuation of a plunger that prevents the reverse shifter pawl from engaging the reverse gear selector when the transmission is already engaged in a forward gear.","If the PCM detects a level of reverse inhibit circuit voltage that exceeds maximum allowable parameters, a code P0801 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated."],"symptoms":["The shifter may go into reverse while the vehicle is moving forward\nThe shifter may fail to go into reverse\nThere may be no symptoms exhibited\nBlown fuses in transmission control related circuits"],"causes":["Defective reverse inhibit solenoid\nBad reverse inhibit sensor\nOpen or shorted reverse inhibit control circuit\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
