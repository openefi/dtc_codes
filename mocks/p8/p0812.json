{"code":"P0812","description":"Reverse Input Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Toyota, Honda, Acura, Lexus, Geo, General Motors, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0812, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the reverse input signal circuit.","The transmission control module (TCM) may be a stand alone module or part of the PCM. Like the TCM, the reverse sensor for the transmission may be a single component or it may be part of the neutral safety switch. Vehicle applications with a manual transmission typically use a separate reverse position sensor and automatic transmissions use the neutral safety switch.","The transmission controller calculates data from the vehicle speed sensor and wheel speed sensors to determine whether or not the vehicle is in motion; and in what direction. The PCM also runs self tests periodically to make sure that system circuit voltage is within parameters.","If the PCM detects that the vehicle is moving in a reverse direction without the appropriate reverse sensor signal, a code P0812 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Reverse lamps are inoperative\nReverse lamps are continuously illuminated\nNo symptoms may be exhibited"],"causes":["Defective reverse position sensor\nBad Neutral safety switch\nShorted wiring for reverse position sensor\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
