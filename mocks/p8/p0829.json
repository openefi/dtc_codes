{"code":"P0829","description":"5-6 Shift Malfunction","info":["On vehicles with electronically controlled automatic transmissions, the 5-6 shift solenoid is responsible for actuating the hydraulic circuits to activate clutches or bands that change gears inside the automatic transmission. The shift solenoids are controlled by either a Transmission Control Module (TCM), or the Engine Control Unit / Powertrain Control Module (ECU / PCM). The control circuit may be power or ground side controlled depending on the application.","\nÂ ","Some vehicles self-test the circuit even when the gear is not in use, the 5-6 shift solenoid may be an on / off solenoid, or duty cycle controlled. The PCM or TCM looks for an inductive kick to determine if the solenoid is functioning properly even when not in use. This brief activation is too fast for the solenoid to actually cause a shift in the transmission. When the solenoid is activated and turned off, the magnetic field collapses sending a slightly higher voltage to the PCM which is used to determine if the solenoid is functioning properly. Note: This DTC is nearly identical to P0781, P0782, P0783, and P0784."],"symptoms":["Check engine light illuminated (Malfunction Indicator Lamp / MIL)\nVehicle will not shift from 5th to 6th gear","This condition may illuminate a check engine light and possibly shut down the transmission controls altogether resulting in a \"failsafe\" mode that will only allow one default gear depending on the vehicles state with all solenoids off."],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0829 code include:","5-6 shift solenoid failure\nElectrical short to power - pinched wires\nElectrical short to ground - pinched wires\nOpen in power or ground circuit wiring - disconnected or loose connections\nTCM or PCM internal failure"]}
