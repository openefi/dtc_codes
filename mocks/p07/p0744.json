{"code":"P0744","description":"Torque Converter Clutch Circuit Intermittent","info":["Modern vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions / transaxles use a torque converter between the engine and transmission to increase the engine torque output and drive the rear wheels.","\nÂ ","The engine and transmission are actually connected by a fluid coupling mechanism inside of the torque converter which is what multiplies the torque until the speeds equalize and create a \"stall\" speed where the difference in actual engine RPM and transmission input RPM is around 90% efficient. Torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoids commanded by the Powertrain control module/Engine control module (PCM/ECM) or the Transmission control module (TCM) to direct hydraulic fluid and engage the torque converter clutch to create a solid coupling and increase efficiency.","The transmission control module has detected a fault with the circuit that operates the torque converter clutch solenoid.","Note: This code is similar to codes P0740, P0741, P0742, P0743, P2769, and P2770.","There may be other diagnostic trouble codes associated with the transmission control module that can only be accessed by using an advanced scan tool. If any additional transmission related DTC's appear in addition to the P0744, an electrical failure is likely."],"symptoms":["Intermittent Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated (a.k.a.
