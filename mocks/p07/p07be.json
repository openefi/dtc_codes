{"code":"P07BE","description":"Transmission Park Position Sensor/Switch A/B Circuit Correlation","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to OBD-II vehicles that have a transmission park position switch/sensor. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Ford, Toyota, Land Rover, VW, Chevrolet, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","Trouble code P07BE is one of several possible codes associated to the Transmission Park Position Sensor/Switch circuit.","\nÂ ","This code is an indication that the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) has detected a correlation problem between the \"A\" and \"B\" transmission park position sensor/switch circuits. The specific situation determines the code activated by the PCM and the check engine light or the service engine soon light will be illuminated.","The purpose of the transmission park position sensor/switch circuit is to monitor the status of the transmission. This circuit sends a signal to the PCM when the transmission is placed into the park position. Based on the specific vehicle, this circuit is commonly a safety feature to prevent the starter from engaging with the automatic transmission in gear.","Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to determine the location of the A and B circuits in your particular application."],"symptoms":["Vehicle will not start (starter will not engage)\nStarter will engage with the vehicle in gear\nAn illuminated Service Engine Soon Light\nCheck Engine Light is illuminated\nTransmission may not shift out of park\nTransmission may not shift into park"],"causes":["Defective transmission park position sensor/switch\nCorroded or damaged connector\nDamaged or faulty wiring\nDefective PCM"]}
