{"code":"P07B4","description":"Transmission Park Position Sensor/Switch A Circuit High","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to OBD-II vehicles that have a transmission park position switch/sensor. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Ford, Toyota, Land Rover, VW, Chevrolet, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","Trouble code P07B4 is one of several possible codes associated to the Transmission Park Position Sensor/Switch \"A\" Circuit.","\nÂ ","This code is an indication that the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) has detected a malfunction that is affecting the operation of the transmission park position sensor/switch \"B\" circuit. The codes that are commonly associated to transmission park position sensor/switch \"A\" circuit malfunctions are P07B2, P07B3, P07B4, P07B5, P07B6, and P07B7. The specific situation determines the code activated by the PCM and the check engine light or the service engine soon light will be illuminated.","The purpose of the transmission park position sensor/switch \"A\" circuit is to monitor the status of the transmission. This circuit sends a signal to the PCM when the transmission is placed into the park position. Based on the specific vehicle, this circuit is commonly a safety feature to prevent the starter from engaging with the automatic transmission in gear.","Code P07B4 is set by the PCM when the transmission park position sensor/switch \"A\" circuit is detected as having high output voltage."],"symptoms":["Vehicle will not start (starter will not engage)\nStarter will engage with the vehicle in gear\nAn illuminated Service Engine Soon Light\nCheck Engine Light is illuminated\nTransmission may not shift out of park\nTransmission may not shift into park"],"causes":["Defective transmission park position sensor/switch\nCorroded or damaged connector\nDamaged or faulty wiring\nDefective PCM"]}
