{"code":"P2266","description":"Water in Fuel Sensor Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Land Rover (Range Rover), Ford, Hyundai, Jeep, Mahindra, Vauxhall, Dodge, Ram, Mercedes, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","The OBD-II trouble code P2266 is associated with the water in fuel sensor circuit, also known as the fuel composition circuit. When the Power Control Module (PCM) detects too low of an electrical signal within the water in fuel sensor circuit, code P2266 will be set and the check engine light will be illuminated. The water in fuel light may also be illuminated if the vehicle incorporates this warning indicator. Refer to a vehicle specific resource to find the sensor location for your particular year / make / model configuration.","The purpose of the water in fuel sensor is to monitor the fuel which passes through it to ensure that ethanol, water, and other contaminants do not exceed a certain percentage. Additionally, fuel temperature is measured by the water in fuel sensor and converted into a voltage pulse width monitored by the PCM. The PCM utilizes these readings to adjust the engine timing for optimum performance and fuel economy.","A typical water in fuel sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine may stall\nSevere misfiring\nEngine will not start\nPoor fuel economy\nPoor performance\nCheck engine light illuminated\nWater in fuel light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective water in fuel sensor\nContaminated fuel\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nDefective or worn fuel filter\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty ECU"]}
