{"code":"P2282","description":"Air Leak Between Throttle Body and Intake Valves","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Vauxhall, Chevrolet, Suzuki, Saturn, Chevy, Corsa, Ford, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","If your vehicle has stored a code P2282, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a degree of airflow at the throttle body which does not exist in the combustion chamber.","In order for today’s engines to perform at peak efficiency, air and fuel must be regulated precisely. The fuel pump and fuel injectors provide fuel in adequate supply and the throttle body (or throttle bodies) allows metered air to enter the intake. The delicate air/fuel ratio must be carefully monitored and adjusted; constantly. This is accomplished using the PCM with inputs from engine sensors such as the MAF, the manifold air pressure (MAP) sensor, and the heated oxygen sensors (HO2S).","After comparing the amount of ambient air being drawn into the MAF sensor and the air being drawn into the engine intake manifold, if the PCM detects that the two exceed the maximum allowable threshold for variation, a code P2282 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple drive cycles with a failure may be required for MIL illumination.","A typical MAF sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Severely diminished engine performance\nThe engine may shutoff upon acceleration\nBackfires can also occur upon acceleration\nMisfire codes could accompany the P2282"],"causes":["Large vacuum leak on or near the intake manifold\nDefective MAP or MAF sensor\nBad intake manifold gasket\nPCM or programming error"]}
