{"code":"P2230","description":"Barometric Pressure Sensor A Intermittent/Erratic","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. Vehicles affected may include but is not limited to Chevy, Mazda, Volvo, Acura, Honda, BMW, Isuzu, Mercedes Benz, Cadillac, Hyundai, Saab, Ford, GMC, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","Most ECMs (Engine Control Modules) rely on a varying amount of measurements to accurately provide the engine an optimal air to fuel ratio. The \"optimal\" air/fuel ratio is called the \"stoichiometric\" mixture, 14.7 parts air to one part fuel. Some of the values the ECM monitors to keep the fuel mixture as stoichiometric as possible are, but not limited to: air flow, coolant temperature, engine speed, load demand, atmospheric temperature, etc. Some engine management systems rely more on intake and atmospheric pressures to optimize the mixture.","Not to mention these systems use less sensors to accomplish similar results, as far as fuel management/efficiency is concerned anyway. Usually, BAPs (Barometric Air Pressure) sensors are used when MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensors are also present. BAPs are used to measure atmospheric pressure. This value is integral to determine fuel mixtures because the ECM needs to compare atmospheric pressures to intake manifold pressures to accurately adjust the fuel mixture according to the operator's driving needs. Altitude is a significant factor to consider when diagnosing BAPs. Depending on your location, your symptoms may actively worsen or improve, especially if you commute frequently through mountainous areas.","When a letter is included within an OBD2 fault code's description (in this case \"A\"), most times it will be to pinpoint something specific (i.e. different banks, sensors, circuits, connectors, etc.) about the system in which you are working within. In this case, I would say it is to determine which sensor you are working with. A lot of times, there will be multiple barometric sensors to ensure accurate readings. Also, to correlate between sensors to assist fuel management not to mention it helps find faults within the sensors or the circuits. All that said, refer to your service manual for specific details on letter specifications for your particular vehicle.","P2230 is set by the ECM when it detectsthe Barometric pressure (BAP) \"A\" sensor or it's circuit(s) has an electrical fault that isn't consistent or coming and going randomly throughout some drive cycles.","A barometric pressure sensor:\n\n"],"symptoms":["Lack of engine power and performance (or limited)\nEngine misfiring\nAbnormal engine noise(s)\nFuel smell\nDecrease in the fuel economy\nDecreased throttle responsiveness"],"causes":["Defective or damaged BAP (Barometric Air pressure) sensor\nDefective or damaged electrical connector\nWiring issue (e.g. open, short, corrosion)\nElectrical short (internal or mechanical)\nLoose electrical connection\nHeat damage\nMechanical malfunction causing altered BAP readings\nECM (Engine Control Module) issue"]}
