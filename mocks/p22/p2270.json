{"code":"P2270","description":"O2 Sensor Signal Biased/Stuck Lean Bank 1 Sensor 2","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all OBD-II equipped vehicles, 1996-newer. Auto brands may include but are not limited to Chevy, Subaru, GMC, Ford, Mini, VW, Mazda, etc. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","\n ","This P2270 diagnostic trouble code (DTC) refers to the post-catalytic converter O2 (oxygen) sensor on bank #1, sensor #2. This post-cat sensor is used for monitoring the efficiency of the catalytic converter. The converter’s job is to reduce emissions out the tailpipe. When the signal from the O2 sensor is detected by the PCM as being stuck lean or biased lean, this DTC is set.","The P2270 DTC refers to downstream sensor (after the catalytic converter), sensor #2 on bank #1. Bank #1 is the side of the engine that contains cylinder #1. There may be a third sensor downstream, if that is the problem, a P2274 is set.","This code is basically telling you that the signal put out by the particular oyxgen sensor is stuck lean (meaning too much air in the exhaust).","Note: Some manufacturers such as Ford may refer to this as a Catalyst Monitor Sensor, same thing, different name. This DTC is very similar to P2195. If you have multiple DTC codes, fix them in the order they appear.","A typical oxygen O2 sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Most likely you will not notice any drivability issues since this is not sensor #1. You will notice Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination. In some cases however, the engine may run rough."],"causes":["The causes for this DTC may include:","Exhaust leak near O2 sensor\nContaminated or failed HO2S2 (Sensor 2)\nHO2S2 wiring/circuit problem\nLoose installation of HO2S2\nFuel pressure incorrect\nFaulty fuel injector\nEngine coolant leak\nFaulty purge solenoid valve\nPCM has failed"]}
