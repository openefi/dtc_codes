{"code":"P2281","description":"Air Leak Between MAF and Throttle Body","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Ram, Volvo, Ford, Porsche, Chevrolet, GMC, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","If your vehicle has stored a code P2281, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a degree of airflow at the mass airflow (MAF) sensor which does not exist at the throttle body.","In order for today’s engines to perform at peak efficiency, air and fuel must be regulated precisely. The fuel pump and fuel injectors provide fuel in adequate supply and the throttle body (or throttle bodies) allows metered air to enter the intake. The delicate air/fuel ratio must be carefully monitored and adjusted; constantly. This is accomplished using the PCM with inputs from engine sensors such as the MAF, the manifold air pressure (MAP) sensor, and the heated oxygen sensors (HO2S).","After comparing the amount of ambient air being drawn into the MAF sensor and the air being drawn into the engine intake manifold, if the PCM detects that the two exceed the maximum allowable threshold for variation, a code P2281 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple drive cycles with a failure may be required for MIL illumination.","A typical MAF sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Severely diminished engine performance\nThe engine may shutoff upon acceleration\nBackfires can also occur upon acceleration\nMisfire codes could accompany the P2281"],"causes":["Torn or collapsed air inlet pipe\nDefective MAP or MAF sensor\nPCV breather tube removed from air inlet pipe\nPCM or programming error"]}
