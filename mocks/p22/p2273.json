{"code":"P2273","description":"O2 Sensor Signal Biased/Stuck Rich Bank 2 Sensor 2","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all OBD-II equipped vehicles, 1996-newer. Auto brands may include but are not limited to Hyundai, Ford, Jeep, Chevy, BMW, Kia, Holden, Dodge, etc. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","\nÂ ","This P2273 diagnostic trouble code (DTC) refers to the post-catalytic converter O2 (oxygen) sensor on bank #2, sensor #2. This post-cat sensor is used for monitoring the efficiency of the catalytic converter. The converter's job is to reduce emissions out the tailpipe. When the signal from the O2 sensor is detected by the PCM as being stuck Rich or biased Rich, this DTC is set.","The P2273 DTC refers to downstream sensor (after the catalytic converter), sensor #2 on bank #2. Bank #2 is the side of the engine that does not contain the #1 cylinder. There may be a third sensor downstream, if that is the problem, a P2277 is set.","This code is basically telling you that the signal put out by the particular oyxgen sensor is stuck rich (meaning too little air in the exhaust). It is somewhat common to see both the P2271 and P2273 codes set at the same time, depending on the vehicle and root cause of the problem.","A typical oxygen O2 sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Most likely you will not notice any drivability issues since this is not sensor #1. You will notice Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination. In some cases however, the engine may run rough."],"causes":["The causes for this DTC may include:","Contaminated or failed HO2S2 (Sensor 2)\nHO2S2 wiring/circuit problem\nFuel pressure incorrect\nFaulty fuel injector\nEngine coolant leak\nFaulty purge solenoid valve\nPCM has failed"]}
