{"code":"P2801","description":"Generic: Transmission Range Sensor \"B\" Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all makes/models, 1996-newer. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","P2801 is a generic powertrain DTC in the transmission controls sub system group. This is a \"C\" type DTC. \"C\" type DTC’S are non-emission related so the powertrain control module (PCM) does not turn on the check engine light or store freeze frame data.","\n ","The transmission range sensor may be referred to as the park/neutral switch (PN), or the neutral safety switch. Its purpose is to inform the PCM of the position of the gear shifter and to allow the engine to start only in the park and neutral positions. The PCM sends a voltage reference to the sensor and the sensor sends a different voltage back the PCM depending on which gear the shifter is in. If the return voltage is not what it is supposed to be this code will set.","Example of an external Transmission Range Sensor (TRS):\n\nTRS image from Dorman"],"symptoms":["Because the neutral safety switch is part of the transmission range sensor the vehicle may start in any gear position and/or the PCM will force the transmission in to \"limp\" mode. In this mode there is an obvious lack of power, especially from a complete stop.","There is a serious safety concern when this code is present due to the possibility of the vehicle starting in gear causing it to start moving upon start up. This problem should be corrected immediately."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty transmission range sensor \"B\"\nMisadjusted transmission range sensor \"B\"\nOpen or shorted transmission range sensor harness\nFaulty PCM"]}
