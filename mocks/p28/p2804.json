{"code":"P2804","description":"Transmission Range Sensor \"B\" Circuit High","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all makes/models, 1996-newer. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in the transmission sub-group. It is a type \"B\" code meaning that the powertrain control module (PCM) or the transmission control module (TCM) will not turn on the check engine light unless the conditions to set the code are present for two consecutive key cycles. (key on-off, off-on)","\nÂ ","The PCM/TCM uses the transmission range sensor, sometimes called the inhibitor switch, to identify which gear position the shift lever is in. The code definition itself explains the problem that is causing the code; the signal from the range sensor is not present all of the time, or it is intermittently missing.","Example of an external Transmission Range Sensor (TRS):\n\nTRS image from Dorman"],"symptoms":["After the second key cycle, the PCM/TCM will turn on the check engine light and force the transmission into \"Limp-home\" or \"safe-mode\". There will be an obvious power loss, most noticeable when taking off from complete stops. When in this mode, the transmission starts off in third gear which is hard on the internal clutches in the transmission.","In my experience this can cause severe internal damage to the transmission so it should be corrected as soon as possible. Avoid using the vehicle until repairs can be made."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty transmission range sensor \"B\"\nFaulty wiring \"B\"\n(Rarely) Faulty PCM or TCM"]}
