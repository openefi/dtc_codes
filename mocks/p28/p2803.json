{"code":"P2803","description":"Transmission Range Sensor \"B\" Circuit High","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all makes/models, 1996-newer. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in the transmission sub-group. It is a type \"B\" DTC which means that the powertrain control module (PCM) or Transmission control module (TCM) will not illuminate the check engine light until the conditions to set the code are detected on two consecutive key sequences. ( key on-off, off-on)","\nÂ ","The PCM or TCM uses the transmission range sensor, also called the inhibitor switch, to determine the position of the shift lever. If it receives signals that indicate two different gear positions at the same time for more than 30 seconds P2803 will be set. If this occurs twice in a row the check engine light will come on and the transmission will be commanded into \"fail-safe\" or \"limp-home\" mode.","Example of an external Transmission Range Sensor (TRS):\n\nTRS image from Dorman"],"symptoms":["The check engine light will come on accompanied by an obvious lack of power taking off from complete stops due to the transmission starting in third gear.","Continuing to drive the vehicle could result in severe transmission damage. I recommend getting it repaired immediately to avoid costly internal transmission repairs."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty transmission range sensor \"B\"\nMisadjusted transmission shift cable/linkage\nDamaged wiring\nMisadjusted range sensor \"B\"\n(Rarely) PCM or TCM failure"]}
