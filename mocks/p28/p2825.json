{"code":"P2825","description":"Pressure Control Solenoid J Control Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This is a generic transmission diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to OBD-II vehicles with an automatic transmission. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, Honda, BMW, Saturn, Land Rover, Acura, Nissan, Saturn, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","In most circumstances automatic transmissions will incorporate at least three pressure control solenoids know as solenoid A, B and C. Newer transmissions tend to have more gears and more solenoids, giving you solenoids D, E, F, etc. Various trouble codes are associated to the \"J\" solenoid control circuit and some of the most common include P2824, P2825, P2826, and P2827. When the P2825 OBD-II trouble code is set, the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) has detected a problem with the transmission pressure control solenoid \"J\" control circuit.  The specific code set is based on the specific malfunction that is detected by the PCM.","An automatic transmission is controlled by bands and clutches that change gears by having fluid pressure in the right place at the right time. The purpose of the transmission pressure control solenoids is to adjust the pressure of the fluid for the automatic transmission to operate properly and shift smoothly. The PCM monitors the pressure within the solenoids and directs fluid to various hydraulic circuits that change the transmission gear ratio precisely as needed.","Code P2825 is set by the PCM when it detects that the \"J\" pressure control solenoid control circuit is out of normal range for optimum performance.","Example of transmission solenoids:\n"],"symptoms":["Increased fuel consumption\nCheck Engine Light activated\nTransmission overheats\nTransmission slips when shifting\nTransmission shifts hard (banging into gear)\nPossibly misfire-like symptoms\nThe transmission is put into limp mode by the PCM"],"causes":["Defective pressure control solenoid\nContaminated transmission fluid\nRestricted transmission filter\nDefective transmission pump\nDefective transmission valve body\nBlocked hydraulic passages\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty PCM"]}
