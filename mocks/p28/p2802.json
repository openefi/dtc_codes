{"code":"P2802","description":"Transmission Range Sensor \"B\" Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all makes/models, 1996-newer. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) for the transmission control system. It is a type \"C\" DTC that does not cause a check engine light, but may cause the overdrive (O/D) or D4 indicator to blink. Only Emission related codes cause a check engine light.","\nÂ ","The transmission range sensor works by receiving a voltage signal. Changing or rerouting it according to position of the gear shifter. In the DTC description it indicates a low condition in the circuit. This is referring to low or no voltage signal returning to the PCM. Refer to the diagram in the diagnosis/repair section below.","Example of an external Transmission Range Sensor (TRS):\n\nTRS image from Dorman"],"symptoms":["The engine my exibit a no start condition due the park/neutral switch which is internal on most transmission range sensors. It could have erratic shifting or even possibly start in gear. It could also have a lack of power due the transmission controls being \"limp home\" mode.","There is certainly a safety factor to be considered in association with this code and should be repaired as soon as possible."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty transmission range sensor \"B\"\nOpen or shorted wiring\nMisadjusted transmission range sensor \"B\"\nFaulty PCM"]}
