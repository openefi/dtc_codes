{"code":"P0393","description":"Camshaft Position Sensor B Circuit High Input (Bank 2)","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC), which means it covers all makes/models starting around 2003. The code seems more common on Kia, Hyundai, Chevrolet, Toyota, and Ford vehicles, but any make vehicle can be affected.","Specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","\n ","These vehicles can have a single camshaft in block, or a single (SOHC) or dual (DOHC) overhead camshafts, but this code is strictly concerned about the incoming signal from the camshaft position sensor(s) \"B\" from Bank 1 being missing, typically at engine start up. This is an electrical circuit fault. Bank #2 is the bank of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.","The PCM uses the Camshaft Position Sensor to tell it when the Crankshaft Sensor signal is correct, when a given Crankshaft Position Sensor signal is timed to Cylinder #1 for timing, and it is also used for fuel injector synchronization / start of injection.","Codes P0390 or P0391 may also be present at the same time as the P0393. The only difference between these 3 codes is how long the problem lasts and the type of electrical problem that the sensor/circuit/engine controller is having. Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of camshaft position sensor and wire colors."],"symptoms":["Check Engine Light on\nBucking or Surging\nDies out, but may restart if the problem is inconsistent\nMay run fine, until it is restarted; then will not restart"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code are:","Open in the ground circuit to the camshaft position sensor \"B\" on Bank 2\nOpen in the signal circuit between the camshaft position sensor \"B\" and the PCM\nShort to 5 volts in the signal circuit to the camshaft position sensor\nOccasionally-Camshaft Position Sensor faulty – internally shorted to voltage"],"type":"WARN"}
