{"code":"P0315","description":"Crankshaft Position System Variation Not Learned","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to fuel injected engines from most manufacturers since 2003.","Those manufacturers include but are not limited to Dodge, Chrysler, Ford, Jeep, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Kia, Isuzu, and Hyundai.","\n ","This code is focused on the relationship between the crankshaft position sensor (CPS) and the engine controller (ECM/PCM). The PCM measures the variation between crankshaft position reference points. These measurements are compared to an ideal reference stored in the PCM. If the variation exceeds a calibrated percentage, a fault code is stored. This is typically an electrical circuit fault, although mechanical issues can affect this code, depending upon vehicle manufacturer.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon vehicle manufacturer and the type of crankshaft position sensor (CPS) and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) on\nMisfire / bucking or surging\nDies out, but may restart if the problem is inconsistent\nMay run fine, until it is restarted; then will not restart\nEngine will crank over, but will not run"],"causes":["Typically, the causes for this code to set are:","Crankshaft position re-learn procedure not performed / improperly performed – one of the more common causes\nWorn timing components, to include the timing chain and timing gears, distributor or even the flex plate (the part that the starter uses to crank the engine over with) – next most common, along with:\nFaulty Crankshaft Position Sensor – common failure point\nOpen in the power or ground circuit to the crankshaft position sensor\nOpen in the signal circuit between the crankshaft position sensor and the PCM\nFailed PCM - rarely"],"type":"ERR"}
