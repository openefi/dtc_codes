{"code":"P0313","description":"Misfire Detected with Low Fuel","info":["This is a generic powertrain code, which means it covers all makes/models, 1996-newer. However, specific troubleshooting steps will vary depending on the vehicle.","Code P0313 refers to an engine misfire under low fuel conditions. It is one of a few ambiguous codes on a vehicle, which if taken at face value, diagnosed and corrected seems straightforward enough.","\nÂ ","The code is set when the computer --through signals from a range of sensors -- determines that the engine miss is due to a lean (to much air and not enough fuel) condition. If the fuel level is low enough to uncover the fuel pump, sporadic pressure surges due to the pump's inability to pick up the remaining fuel will cause a \"Lean\" condition.","In all likelihood you have either lowered the fuel level to low before refilling, or you have a legitimate fuel delivery problem. If the fuel system proves to be working properly, several other mechanical failures can cause this scenario."],"symptoms":["Trouble code P0313 misfire detected with low fuel\nRough running engine\nHard or no start\nHesitation on acceleration\nLack of power"],"causes":["The causes for this DTC may include:","Most likely:","Low fuel level exposing fuel pump\nFailing fuel pump\nFuel filter clogged\nFuel pressure regulator failure\nClogged or failed fuel injectors\nShort or open circuit in fuel pump harness\nPoor electrical connectors","Additional possibilites:","Spark plugs\nIgnition wires\nFaulty reluctor ring\n\nCarbon-fouled valves\nMass air flow sensor\nFaulty distributor cap\nFaulty coil packs\nLack of compression\nLarge vacuum leak"],"type":"WARN"}
