{"code":"P033B","description":"Knock Sensor 4 Circuit Range/Performance (Bank 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Knock sensors are used to detect engine pre-detonation (engine knock or ping). The knock sensor (KS) is usually a two wire sensor. A 5 volt reference is supplied to the sensor and there is a signal return from the knock sensor to the PCM (powertrain control module). For this DTC it refers to the #4 knock sensor on bank 2, refer to a vehicle specific service manual for the specific location. Bank 2 is always the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.","\nÂ ","The sensor signal wire informs the PCM when a knock occurs and in what degree of severity. The PCM will retard the spark timing to avoid pre-detonation. Most PCMs have the ability to learn spark knock trends in the engine during normal operation.","If the PCM determines that the knock is out of the ordinary or that the noise level is abnormally high, P033B may set. If the PCM senses that the knock is severe and cannot be eliminated by retarding the spark timing, P033B may set. Keep in mind that knock sensors cannot distinguish between a knock from pre-detonation or one from engine problems."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nAudible knocking from the engine compartment\nPinging from engine under acceleration"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P033B code include:","Knock sensor circuit is shorted to voltage\nKnock sensor has failed\nKnock sensor connector is damaged\nKnock sensor circuit is open or shorted to ground\nMoisture in knock sensor connectors\nIncorrect fuel octane\nPCM has failed"],"type":"ERR"}
