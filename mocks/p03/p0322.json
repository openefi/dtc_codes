{"code":"P0322","description":"Ignition/Distributor Engine Speed Input Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all spark ignition engines, including but not limited to certain Audi, Mazda, Mercedes and VW vehicles.","The Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) provides crankshaft position or crankshaft timing to the Powertrain Control Module or PCM. This information is typically used for engine rpm.","\nÂ ","The camshaft position sensor (CMP) provides the PCM with the exact location of the camshaft, camshaft timing or distributor timing. Anytime the voltage drops below a set level in either of these two circuits, the PCM will set code P0322. This code is considered to be an electrical circuit fault only.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor, and wire colors to the sensor.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nEngine cranks but will not start\nMisfire, Hesitation, Stumble, Lack of Power"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Open in the control circuit (ground circuit) between the ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor and the PCM\nOpen in the power supply circuit between the ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor and the PCM\nShort to ground in the power supply circuit to the ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor\nIgnition/distributor/engine speed sensor faulty\nPossibly a PCM has failed (highly unlikely)"],"type":"WARN"}
