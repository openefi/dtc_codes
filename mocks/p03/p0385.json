{"code":"P0385","description":"Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The crankshaft position sensor (CKP) measures crankshaft location and relays this information to the PCM (Powertrain Control Module). Depending on the vehicle, the PCM uses this crankshaft position information to time the spark properly or on some systems it is only for misfire detection and does not control spark timing.","\nÂ ","The CKP sensor is stationary and works in harmony with a reluctor ring (or toothed ring) that is attached to the crankshaft. As this reluctor ring passes in front of the CKP sensor, the magnetic field created by the CKP sensor is interrupted and this creates a square wave voltage signal that the PCM interprets as crankshaft position. If the PCM detects that there are no crankshaft pulses or if it sees a problem with the pulses on the output circuit, P0385 will set.","Related crank position sensor B trouble codes:","P0386 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Range/Performance\nP0387 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Low Input\nP0388 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit High Input\nP0389 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Intermittent"],"symptoms":["Vehicle may not start (see above)\nVehicle may run rough or misfire\nMIL illumination"],"causes":["A P0385 \"check engine light\" code could be caused by:","Damaged CKP sensor connector\nDamaged reluctor ring (missing teeth or not turning due to sheared-off keyway)\nSensor output open\nSensor output shorted to ground\nSensor output shorted to voltage\nFailed crank sensor\nFailed PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
