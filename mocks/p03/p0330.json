{"code":"P0330","description":"Knock Sensor 2 Circuit Malfunction (Bank 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A knock sensor tells the engine computer when one or more of your engine's cylinders are \"knocking\", that is, exploding the air/fuel mixture in a way that delivers less power and can be damaging to the engine if prolonged. The computer uses this information to tune the engine so that it doesn't knock. If your knock sensor wasn't operating properly, so that it was always indicating a knock, the engine computer's response may have been to change the ignition timing on your engine. Knock sensors generally bolt into or thread into the engine block.","\nÂ ","This P0330 code may show up intermittently or the Service Engine light may be lit constantly. Other knock sensor related DTC codes include P0325."],"symptoms":["You may notice drivability problems including a lack of power and perhaps some hesitation.
