{"code":"P0317","description":"Rough Road Hardware Not Present","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (VW, Ford, Audi, Buick, GM, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A P0317 trouble code belongs to the category of codes that include ignition system codes. The reason for that is that many times, the \"rough road hardware\" is actually an interpretation from sensors that have basically detected that the engine's crankshaft moves in an unexpected manner.","\nÂ ","The system of sensors and the vehicle's PCM, or powertrain control module, can indicate rough terrain conditions. For example, the engine speed can be erratic when the vehicle is driven over really rough road or off-road conditions. This can cause the PCM to see it as an engine fault such as a misfire.","Some vehicles may have a road sensor, an accelerometer, or some may use a ABS wheel sensors and the Electronic Brake Control Module (EBCM) to help determine rough road conditions.","Regardless of the exact system used in your vehicle, if you get this trouble code, it means the PCM has detected a rough road condition that requires attention. Typically this code is only set after the readings are the same after multiple drives."],"symptoms":["Most trouble codes trigger the check engine light (or MIL malfunction indicator light). For this P0317 DTC, the light is not illuminated. You may, however, have other warning lamps illuminated (traction control, ABS, etc.) or even have some engine misfires or rough running."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty rough road sensor (if equipped)\nWiring / electrical fault related to sensors\nControl unit needs initialization of new road sensor\nOther possible causes"],"type":"ERR"}
