{"code":"P0300","description":"Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. So this engine code article applies to Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Dodge, Honda, GMC, etc.","Basically this P0300 code means that the the car's computer has detected that not all of the engine's cylinders are firing properly.","A P0300 diagnostic code indicates a random or multiple misfire. If the last digit is a number other than zero, it corresponds to the cylinder number that is misfiring. A P0302 code, for example, would tell you cylinder number two is misfiring. Unfortunately, a P0300 doesn't tell you specifically which cylinder(s) is/are mis-firing, nor why."],"symptoms":["the engine may be harder to start\nthe engine may stumble / stumble, and/or hesitate\nother symptoms may also be present"],"causes":["A code P0300 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Faulty spark plugs or wires\nFaulty coil (pack)\nFaulty oxygen sensor(s)\nFaulty fuel injector(s)\nBurned exhaust valve\nFaulty catalytic converter(s)\nStuck/blocked/leaking EGR valve / passages\nFaulty camshaft position sensor\nDefective computer"],"type":"ERR"}
