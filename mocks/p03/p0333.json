{"code":"P0333","description":"Knock Sensor 2 Circuit High Input (Bank 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Knock sensors are used to detect engine pre-detonation (engine knock or ping).","\nÂ ","The knock sensor (KS) is usually a two wire sensor. A 5 volt reference is supplied to the sensor and there is a signal return from the knock sensor to the PCM (powertrain control module). The sensor signal wire informs the PCM when a knock occurs and in what degree of severity. The PCM will retard the spark timing to avoid pre-detonation. Most PCMs have the ability to learn spark knock trends in the engine during normal operation.","A P0333 code is a generic DTC, thus it applies to all makes of vehicles, and refers to a high output voltage of the knock sensor. In many cases, this means the voltage is above 4.5V but that specific value depends on the specific make and model of vehicle. This code refers to the sensor on bank #2 (the side of the engine that doesn't contain cylinder #1)."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nAudible knocking from the engine compartment\nPinging from engine under acceleration\nLoss of power\nIrregular RPM"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0333 code include:","Knock sensor connector is damaged\nKnock sensor circuit is open or shorted to ground\nKnock sensor circuit is shorted to voltage\nKnock sensor has failed\nLoose knock sensor\nElectrical interference in circuit\nLow fuel pressure\nIncorrect fuel octane\nMechanical engine problem\nFailed/faulty PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
