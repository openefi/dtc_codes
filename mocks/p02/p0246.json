{"code":"P0246","description":"Turbocharger Wastegate Solenoid A High","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to turbocharged and supercharged engines, including but not limited to certain Audi, Ford, GM, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, VW and Volvo vehicles.","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) controls the boost pressure in a gasoline or diesel engine by controlling the output circuit to the \"A\" wastegate/boost pressure control solenoid.","\nÂ ","Depending upon how the manufacturer activates the solenoid, when the PCM provides a power supply or a ground to the solenoid to energize it and the PCM notices that there is already voltage applied to a circuit when there should not be, the PCM will set code P0246. This code is considered to be an electrical circuit fault only.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of wastegate/boost pressure control, and wire colors to the control solenoid.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nInstrument cluster message alerting driver to condition\nLack of power"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Open in the control circuit (ground circuit) between the wastegate/boost pressure control solenoid A and the PCM\nOpen in the power supply circuit between the wastegate/boost pressure control solenoid A and the PCM\nShort to power on the control circuit (power controlled circuit) between the A wastegate/boost pressure control solenoid and the PCM\nWastegate/boost pressure control solenoid A faulty\nPossibly a PCM has failed (highly unlikely)"],"type":"WARN"}
