{"code":"P0216","description":"Injection Timing Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Basically this means the diesel fuel injection pump has a timing failure. This could be that the injection pump timing needs adjusted OR the failure is internal to the injection pump and therefore non-adjustable.","\nÂ ","NOTE: If your vehicle is a Dodge Ram with Cummins engine then be aware that fuel delivery problems frequently cause this code. Prolonged fuel delivery problems can cause injection pump failure!"],"symptoms":["Low power\nCrank, but no start\nHard start\nDisplays an intermittent stumble or miss\nEngine may start and then stall\nEngine may appear to drive fine but surge at idle"],"causes":["The most frequent cause of this code is a bad injection pump due to poor fuel delivery.
