{"code":"P0233","description":"Fuel Pump Secondary Circuit Intermittent","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The fuel pump is powered by the fuel pump relay. When the PCM (powertrain control module) activates the fuel pump relay, voltage is supplied to the fuel pump and it pressurizes the fuel system. Some vehicles have a feedback on the fuel pump supply circuit. This is simply a circuit spliced into the voltage feed to the fuel pump. The splice is usually located close to the PCM.","\nÂ ","The PCM monitors this feedback circuit to ensure that there is proper voltage being sent to the fuel pump. As it activates the fuel pump relay, it expects to see battery voltage on the feedback circuit. If the PCM sees an unexpected intermittent problem with the signal when the fuel pump isn't activated, P0233 may set."],"symptoms":["MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nFuel pump runs with key off\nSmall amount of voltage present on FP (fuel pump) voltage supply circuit due to short"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0233 code include:","Bad FP relay\nShort to voltage on FP voltage supply circuit or feedback circuit\nShort to ground on PCM\nFP relay control circuit PCM\nFP relay control driver shorted to ground internally"],"type":"ERR"}
