{"code":"P024E","description":"Charge Air Cooler Bypass Position Sensor A Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II vehicles equipped with a charge air cooler. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Chevy, Mazda, Toyota, etc.","In forced inducted systems, they use a Charge Air Cooler or what I am going to call it, an Intercooler (IC) to help in cooling the charge air the engine uses. These work similar to a radiator.","\n ","In the IC’s case, instead of cooling antifreeze, it cools air to make for a more efficient air/fuel mixture in turn, better fuel mileage, better performance, etc. The IC is part of the charge pressure side of the induction system. The bypass valve is used just as the name implies, to let the air bypass the intercooler to be dumped into the atmosphere and/or recycled.","The Electronic Control Module (ECM) uses it to adjust valve according to current engine conditions and needs. The ECM also monitors the physical position of the valve by using a Charge Air Cooler Bypass Position Sensor.","The ECM illuminates the check engine light with P024E and associated codes when it monitors a condition outside of a specific range within the IC’s Bypass Control circuit and/or within the sensors involved. This code may be caused by a mechanical and/or electrical fault. If i had to guess here, i would lean towards a mechanical problems more likely being the problem. That being said either are possible.","P024E Charge Air Cooler Bypass Position Sensor A Circuit Low code is set when there is a low electrical value within the position sensor or its circuit."],"symptoms":["Poor engine performance\nVehicle entering \"limp mode\"\nEngine misfiring\nPoor fuel mileage"],"causes":["Stuck open/closed bypass valve\nObstruction in bypass valve's operational range of motion\nCharge air cooler bypass position sensor defective\nBroken or damaged wiring harness\nFuse/relay defective\nECM issue\nPin/connector problem.
