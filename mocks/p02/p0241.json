{"code":"P0241","description":"Generic: Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Sensor \"B\" Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) applicable to all turbocharged or supercharged vehicles. Brands may include but are not limited to Audi, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mazda, VW etc.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors boost pressure with a sensor called the manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP). Understanding how a MAP sensor works is the first step in explaining the cause of P0241.","The PCM sends a 5 volt reference signal to the MAP sensor and the MAP sensor sends a variable voltage signal back to the PCM. When boost pressure is high the voltage signal is high. When boost pressure is low the voltage is low. The PCM uses the boost control solenoid to control the amount of boost pressure that is produce by the turbocharger while at the same time using the boost pressure sensor to verify that the boost pressure is correct.","This code sets when the PCM senses a low voltage signal indicating low boost pressure when a high pressure command has been sent to the boost control solenoid \"B\".\n"],"symptoms":["Check engine light will be on\nLow engine power\nReduced fuel economy","Because of the increased chance of catalytic converter damage and turbo over boost when P0241 is present it should be corrected before continuing to use the vehicle."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty boost sensor \"B\"\nFaulty turbocharger\nFaulty PCM\nWiring problem"],"type":"WARN"}
