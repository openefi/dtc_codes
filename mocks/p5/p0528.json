{"code":"P0528","description":"Fan Speed Sensor Circuit No Signal","info":["Some vehicles are equipped with a sensor at the end of the cooling fan that detects movement during vehicle operation. The sensor is used to determine if the fan is running on a fan clutch equipped vehicle, or used to verify fan speed commanded by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM) matches the actual fan speed detected on an electric fan equipped vehicle.","\nÂ ","The sensor used is a 3 wire, hall effect sensor which uses a 5 volt reference source from the PCM, a ground wire and a signal wire to the PCM to determine fan speed. A P0528 means that the PCM/ECM has determined there is a fault with the sensor or wiring.","Note: Be careful not to touch an electric fan as it may turn on even when the vehicle is not operating. This code is similar to P0526, P0527 and P0529"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp illumination (a.k.a. Check Engine Light)\nVehicle may be overheating or running hotter than normal"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0528 code include:","Faulty fan clutch or electric fan\nOpen circuit in cooling fan sensor harness or connector\nFaulty PCM/ECM\nFaulty cooling fan speed sensor\nAccessory belt broken"],"type":"ERR"}
