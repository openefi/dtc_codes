{"code":"P0504","description":"Brake Switch A/B Correlation","info":["Your vehicle's powertrain control module (PCM) has set this P0504 code in response to a recognized failure in the brake light circuit. The vehicle's computer monitors all circuits for abnormalities such as lack of voltage or an out of range condition.","\nÂ ","The brake light switch is tied into several circuits all of which can result in a hazardous situation. The brake switch itself consists of two signal outputs and if there is a malfunction in the switch, it is detected and sets this code. This is not an expensive proposition in terms of the cost of the part or the labor involved in the replacement. The safety factor demands a repair as soon as possible."],"symptoms":["The brake lights will either be illuminated continuously or fail to illuminate as the pedal is depressed\nIt will be difficult or impossible to shift out of park\nThe vehicle may stall when the brakes are depressed while a cruising speeds\nThe cruise control will not activate"],"causes":["There are several components in this circuit, any of which is capable of compromising the circuit sufficiently to set this code.","The most common is the brake light switch whose failure is due to wear.\nThe brake light fuse will fail at times due to moisture in the circuit or burning out the brake light.\nBrake light bulb failure is another cause many times due to water infiltrating into the lens.\nThe wiring harness, more specifically the connectors are loose or pushed out pins will cause a correlation problem between the switch and PCM.\nLastly, the PCM itself could have failed."],"type":"ERR"}
