{"code":"P0523","description":"Generic: Engine Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch High\nChrysler: Oil Pressure Sensor High Input Conditions\nGM: Engine Oil Pressure Sensor Circuit High Input Conditions","info":["The vehicle's main computer called the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is in control of many sensors, controls, and electronics in the vehicle. One of the sensors called the oil pressure sensor or sender detects the amount of (mechanical) oil pressure in the engine and relays that in the form of a voltage reading/value to the PCM. In some vehicles, that oil pressure value is then relayed to a gauge in the instrument cluster to show the driver the oil pressure, other times that gauge is not there but there will be a warning light if there is a problem.","\nÂ ","This specific P0523 engine code is triggered when the PCM sees too high of a value in the engine oil pressure sender/sensor. The oil pressure sensor operates on a 5 volt circuit. Generally this engine code will be triggered when the voltage is 4.6 or higher. With this trouble code, the cause may be mechanical or electrical, but is most likely to be electrical related. This code is related to these other oil pressure DTCs: P0520, P0521, P0522, and P0524."],"symptoms":["Oil pressure gauge reading high\nOil pressure indicator lamp illuminated"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0523 code include:","High oil pressure (mechanical oil pump fault)\nHigh pressure due to obstruction/restriction in oil passage(s)\nWrong engine oil used\nFaulty wiring or connection/connector in the oil pressure sender circuit\nFaulty oil pressure sender/sensor"],"type":"WARN"}
