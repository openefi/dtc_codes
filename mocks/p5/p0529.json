{"code":"P0529","description":"Fan Speed Sensor Circuit Intermittent","info":["Some vehicles are equipped with a sensor at the end of the cooling fan that detects movement during vehicle operation. The sensor is used to determine if the fan is running on a fan clutch equipped vehicle, or used to verify fan speed commanded by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM) matches the actual fan speed detected on an electric fan equipped vehicle.","\nÂ ","The sensor used is a 3 wire, hall effect sensor which uses a 5 volt reference source from the PCM, a ground wire and a signal wire to the PCM to determine fan speed. Specifically, a P0529 trouble code means the PCM/ECM is not recieving a steady voltage output from the fan sensor signal wire.","Note: Be careful not to touch an electric fan as it may turn on even when the vehicle is not operating. This code is similar to P0526, P0527 and P0528"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp illumination (a.k.a. Check Engine Light)\nVehicle may be overheating or running hotter than normal"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0529 code include:","Loose connection in cooling fan sensor harness or PCM/ECM harness\nFaulty PCM/ECM\nFaulty cooling fan speed sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
