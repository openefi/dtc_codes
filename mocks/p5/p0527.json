{"code":"P0527","description":"Fan Speed Sensor Circuit Range/Performance","info":["Some vehicles are equipped with a sensor at the end of the cooling fan that detects movement during vehicle operation. The sensor is used to determine if the fan is running on a fan clutch equipped vehicle, or used to verify fan speed commanded by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM) matches the actual fan speed detected on an electric fan equipped vehicle.","\nÂ ","The sensor used is a 3 wire, hall effect sensor which uses a 5 volt reference source from the PCM, a ground wire and a signal wire to the PCM to determine fan speed. For a P0527 to be triggered, the PCM/ECM has determined the actual fan speed does not match the desired or commanded speed.","Note: Be careful not to touch an electric fan as it may turn on even when the vehicle is not operating. This code is similar to P0526, P0528 and P0529"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp illumination (a.k.a. Check Engine Light)\nVehicle may be overheating or running hotter than normal"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0527 code include:","Fan clutch or electric fan is not operating at desired or commanded speed"],"type":"ERR"}
