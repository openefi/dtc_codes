{"code":"P0524","description":"Engine Oil Pressure Too Low","info":["The vehicle's main computer called the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is in control of many sensors, controls, and electronics in the vehicle. One of the sensors called the oil pressure sensor or sender detects the amount of (mechanical) oil pressure in the engine and relays that in the form of a voltage reading/value to the PCM. In some vehicles, that oil pressure value is then relayed to a gauge in the instrument cluster to show the driver the oil pressure, other times that gauge is not there but there will be a warning light if there is a problem.","\nÂ ","This specific P0524 engine code is triggered when the PCM sees too low of a value in the engine oil pressure sender/sensor. If the engine oil pressure actually does drop too low, the engine can be permanently damaged, so if you notice low oil pressure, it is critical that you pull over and shut off the vehicle as soon as safely possible.","Note: This code is severe, you need to act right away to diagnose & repair. This code is related to P0520, P0521, P0522 and P0523."],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination (a.k.a. check engine light)\nOil pressure warning indicator lamp illuminated\nOil pressure gauge reading low or zero\nAbnormal engine noise"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0524 code include:","Low oil pressure\nLow oil level\nWrong oil viscosity\nContaminated oil (fuel, coolant, etc.)\nFaulty oil pressure sensor\nSignal shorted to ground in electrical circuit for sensor\nWorn internal engine components (oil pump, worn bearings, etc.)"],"type":"WARN"}
