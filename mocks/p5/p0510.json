{"code":"P0510","description":"Closed Throttle Position Switch Malfunction","info":["The throttle body or linkage on certain vehicles may contain a switch that indicates to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM) when the throttle body is in the closed position. When the throttle body is shut, the switch will be depressed or in the closed position. The PCM uses this switch so the engine will stay at idle in conjunction with the idle air control valve and/or go into a fuel cut mode while coasting.","\nÂ ","There may also be a Wide Open Throttle (WOT) switch. If either the WOT or closed throttle switch are not engaged, the PCM or ECM may assume the throttle is partly open which could affect the air/fuel ratio.","Note: If more than one trouble code is present, such as P0120 (TPS/Pedal Position Sensor A circuit Malfunction) - there may be an open in the ground circuit or bad connection at the Throttle Position Sensor TPS)."],"symptoms":[],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0510 code include:","Wiring harness open circuit or loose/dirty connection\nFaulty closed throttle position switch\nThrottle body idle set screw tampered with\nFaulty ECM"],"type":"ERR"}
