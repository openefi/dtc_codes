{"code":"P0522","description":"Generic: Engine Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch Low\nChrysler: Oil Pressure Sensor Low Input Conditions\nGM: Engine Oil Pressure Sensor Circuit Low Input Conditions","info":["The vehicle's main computer called the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is in control of many sensors, controls, and electronics in the vehicle. One of the sensors called the oil pressure sensor or sender detects the amount of (mechanical) oil pressure in the engine and relays that in the form of a voltage reading/value to the PCM. In some vehicles, that oil pressure value is then relayed to a gauge in the instrument cluster to show the driver the oil pressure, other times that gauge is not there but there will be a warning light if there is a problem.","\nÂ ","This specific P0522 engine code is triggered when the PCM sees too low of a value in the engine oil pressure sender/sensor. If the engine oil pressure actually does drop too low, the engine can be permanently damaged, so if you notice low oil pressure, it is critical that you pull over and shut off the vehicle as soon as safely possible. For this trouble code, the cause is more than likely electrical related.","Note: This code is severe, you need to act right away to diagnose & repair. This code is related to P0520, P0521, P0523, and P0524."],"symptoms":["Oil pressure gauge reading low or zero\nOil pressure indicator lamp illuminated\nEngine may not start\nEngine may quit or stall while driving"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0522 code include:","Faulty wiring or connection/connector in the oil pressure sender circuit\nFaulty oil pressure sender/sensor\nOpen or short in circuit wiring\nLow oil level, wrong oil, oil passage blockage"],"type":"WARN"}
