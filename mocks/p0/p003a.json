{"code":"P003A","description":"Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control A Position Exceeded Learning Limit","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevy (Chevrolet), GMC (Duramax), Dodge, Ram (Cummins), Isuzu, Ford, Vauxhall, VW, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","Turbochargers, superchargers, and any other forced induction (FI) systems for that matter, use energy generated from the engine (i.e.: exhaust pulses, belt-driven screw-type, etc.) to increase the amount of air that can be introduced to the combustion chamber (increased volumetric efficiency).","\nÂ ","Given the fact that, in forced induction systems, intake pressures need to vary and need to be adjusted according to the operator's many power needs. Manufacturers use a form of boost control valve (AKA, Waste-gate, boost control solenoid, etc.), which is monitored and controlled by the ECM (Engine Control Module), to make sure the air/fuel mixture is stoichiometric (ideal). It does this, by mechanically adjusting the \"vanes\" in the charger. These vanes are responsible for adjusting the amount of boost (intake pressure) to the chamber. As you can imagine, a problem within the boost controlling component, may cause drivability issues. The problem is, when the ECM loses control of the boost, typically, your vehicle goes into \"limp\" mode to avoid engine damage (via over/under-boost conditions causing a potentially damaging rich and/or lean A/F mixture).","As far as the letter \"A\" goes here, it could be to distinguish a connector, wire, circuit group, etc. That said, the manufacturer's specifications is the best resource you could have for this.","The ECM illuminates the check engine light (CEL) with P003A and related codes when it detects a fault within the boost control system.","The P003A DTC is activated when the ECM (Engine Control Module) detects the position of the \"A\" boost control arm (connected to the vanes), to be out of desired range(s).","A turbocharger and related components:\n"],"symptoms":["Low, erratic and/or abnormal power levels\nOverall poor drivability\nDecrease in throttle response\nTrouble driving up hills\nVehicle enters \"limp\" mode (i.e. fail-safe)\nIntermittent driveability symptoms"],"causes":["Defective or damaged boost control solenoid (e.g. lever stuck, broken, bent, etc.)\nCorrosion causing high resistance (E.G: Connectors, pins, grounds, etc.)\nWiring issue (e.g. Frayed, open, short to power, short to ground, etc.)\nECM (Engine Control Module) internal issue\nExcessive exhaust soot in vanes of charger, causing stagnant high/low/incorrect boost levels\nBoost control module issue\nExhaust leak"],"type":"ERR"}
