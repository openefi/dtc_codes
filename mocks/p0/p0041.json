{"code":"P0041","description":"O2 Sensor Signals Swapped Bank 1 Sensor 2 / Bank 2 Sensor 2","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic OBD-II powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may vary depending on the make and model. Owners of these these brands may include but are not limited to BMW, Dodge, Ford, Chrylser, Audi, VW, Mazda, Jeep, etc.","In a nutshell, a P0041 code means that the vehicle's computer (the PCM or powertrain control module) has detected that the O2 oxygen sensors downstream from the catalytic converter have swapped wiring.","\nÂ ","The vehicle's PCM uses the multiple oxygen sensor readings to adjust how much fuel to inject into the engine for most efficient operation. The PCM monitors the engine sensor readings and if for example it puts more fuel into bank 2 of the engine but then sees that the bank 1 oxygen sensor is reacting instead of bank 2, that is the type of thing that triggers this code. For this DTC, the #2 O2 oxygen sensor will be downstream from (after) the catalytic converter. You may also experience the P0040 DTC at the same time.","This code is uncommon and only applies to vehicles with engines that have more than one bank of cylinders. Bank 1 is always the bank of the engine that contains cylinder #1."],"symptoms":["Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated solid or flashing\nDecreased engine power or rough running/idle\nIncreased fuel consumption"],"causes":["A P0041 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:","Oxygen sensors #2 wiring connectors swapped from bank to bank (most likely)\nO2 sensors #2 wiring crossed, damaged, and/or shorted\nFailed PCM (less likely)"],"type":"ERR"}
