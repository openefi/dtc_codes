{"code":"P0024","description":"\"B\" Camshaft Position - Timing Over-Advanced or System Performance (Bank 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to Toyota, VW, Ford, Dodge, Honda, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Audi, Acura, etc.","A P0024 code refers to the VVT (variable valve timing) or VCT (variable camshaft timing) components and the car's PCM (powertrain control module) or ECM (engine control module). VVT is a technology used in the engine to allow it to get greater power or efficiency at different running points.","\nÂ ","In this case, if the cam timing is above a set limit (over-advanced), the engine light will be illluminated and the code will be set. The \"B\" camshaft is either the exhaust, right, or rear camshaft. A P0024 trouble code is basically the same as a P0021 code, except this is for camshaft \"B\", not \"A\". Bank 2 is the side of the engine that does NOT contain cylinder #1."],"symptoms":["Most likely a P0024 DTC will result in one of the following: hard starting, poor idle, and/or stalling. There are potentially other symptoms as well. Of course, when trouble codes are set, the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) illuminates."],"causes":["A P0024 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:","Incorrect camshaft timing\nWiring problems (harness/wiring) in intake timing control valve control solenoid system\nContinuous oil flow to VCT piston chamber\nFailed timing valve control solenoid (stuck open)"],"type":"ERR"}
