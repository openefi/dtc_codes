{"code":"P0013","description":"\"B\" Camshaft Position Actuator Circuit (Bank 1)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to Toyota, VW, Honda, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Audi, Acura, etc.","A P0013 code refers to the VVT (variable valve timing) or VCT (variable camshaft timing) components and the car's PCM (powertrain control module) or ECM (engine control module). VVT is a technology used in the engine to allow it to get greater power or efficiency at different running points.","\nÂ ","That consists of an oil control valve (OCV), also called a solenoid valve and other components. This source says it best:","The camshaft position (CMP) actuator is controlled by the powertrain control module (PCM) through a high control circuit and a low reference circuit. The high control circuit carries a 12 volt pulse width modulated (PWM) signal from the PCM to the CMP actuator solenoid in order to control the amount of engine oil flow to the cam phaser. The low reference circuit is used as a return circuit. The PCM has the ability to monitor the functionality of the high control and the low reference circuit. If the PCM detects an open, a short to ground, or a short to voltage, DTC P0013 sets.","The \"B\" camshaft refers to the exhaust, right, or rear camshaft (looking at the engine from the drivers seat). Bank 1 refers to the side of the engine that contains cylinder #1."],"symptoms":["Check Engine Light illuminated (Malfunction Indicator Lamp)\nRough running\nOther symptoms may also be present"],"causes":["A code P0013 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Faulty oil control valve (OCV)\nOpen or short in the OCV / solenoid valve\nDamaged computer (PCM)"],"type":"ERR"}
