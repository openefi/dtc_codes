{"code":"P0087","description":"Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBDII equipped vehicles.","Some vehicles are equipped with a returnless fuel supply, this means that the fuel pump is pulse width modulated and can vary in pump speed to deliver fuel to the rail at a variable rate instead of constantly running the fuel pump and regulating the pressure with a pressure regulator, returning fuel back to the tank.","\nÂ ","There is a sensor on the fuel rail that monitors fuel pressure at the rail to determine fuel pressure and vary the pump speed accordingly. The PCM (powertrain control module) or ECM (engine control module) has detected that fuel pressure is below specification for the supply commanded to the fuel pump driver module or fuel pump assembly."],"symptoms":["Check engine light illuminated, there may be more than one code present such as an oxygen sensor lean or rich code.\nVehicle may have a misfire due to a lean fuel condition, run rough, or lack power on acceleration. This may be more evident at higher RPM's when more fuel is required. An oxygen sensor too lean code may also be present.\nA bad sensor may cause the PCM/ECM to command extra fuel leading to a rich fuel condition which will cause poor fuel economy. An oxygen sensor too rich code may be present."],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0087 trouble code may include:","Weak fuel pump, clogged filter or screen, restricted fuel supply line\nFaulty fuel pump driver module\nFaulty fuel pressure sensor"],"type":"WARN"}
