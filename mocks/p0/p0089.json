{"code":"P0089","description":"Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Performance","info":["The fuel pressure regulator is responsible for maintaining a steady fuel pressure. Some vehicles have a fuel pressure built into the fuel rail assembly. Other vehicles with a returnless fuel supply, the regulator is a part of the fuel pump module inside of the tank.","\nÂ ","Returnless fuel systems are computer controlled and the fuel pump output and actual fuel rail pressure is determined by a fuel pressure sensor on the rail that uses the temperature of the fuel to determine the actual pressure. The Powertrain control module or Engine control module (PCM/ECM) has determined that the fuel pressure commanded is not within specifications and will set the DTC P0089.","Note: On vehicles equipped with returnless fuel systems with only a supply line - where the fuel does not return back to the tank, the fuel pressure commanded and actual values may need to be checked using an advanced scan tool capable of monitoring these values. If there are any other codes such as Lean o2 sensors present along with the P0089, the P0089 code should be solved first before proceeding with other codes.","Related fuel pressure regulator engine codes:","P0090 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit\nP0091 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit Low\nP0092 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit High"],"symptoms":["Poor fuel economy\nPoor acceleration or hesistation\nOther codes may be present such as lean O2 sensors\nCheck Engine Light illuminated (Malfunction Indicator Lamp)"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0089 trouble code may include:","Fuel pump output\nRestricted or pinched fuel lines / clogged fuel filter\nFaulty regulator\nFaulty fuel pressure sensor or electrical wiring"],"type":"ERR"}
