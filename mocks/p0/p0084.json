{"code":"P0084","description":"Exhaust Valve Control Solenoid Circuit (Bank 2)","info":["This code is a generic OBD-II powertrain code, that means it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may vary depending on the model.","\nÂ ","On vehicles equipped with variable valve timing (VVT), the Engine Control Module / Powertrain Control Module (ECM/PCM) controls the camshaft position by regulating the engine oil through the control solenoid to change the position of the camshaft. The control solenoid is commanded using a Pulse Width Modulated signal (PWM) from the ECM/PCM. The ECM/PCM monitors this signal and if the voltage is out of specification or intermittent, it will set this DTC and illuminate the Check Engine Light / Malfunction Indicator Lamp (CEL/MIL).","Bank 2 refers to the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1 - be sure to verify according to manufacturers specifications. The exhaust valve control solenoid is usually located on the exhaust manifold side of the cylinder head. This code is similar to codes P0085 and P0086. This code may also be accompanied by P0029."],"symptoms":["Check engine light illuminated (Malfunction indicator lamp)\nVehicle may suffer from poor acceleration and decreased fuel economy."],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0084 trouble code may include:","Wire harness poor connection or corroded terminals\nFaulty control solenoid\nShort to power\nShort to ground\nFaulty ECM"],"type":"ERR"}
