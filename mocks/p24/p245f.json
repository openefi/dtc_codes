{"code":"P245F","description":"Diesel Particulate Filter Pressure Sensor B Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (Ford, Dodge, GMC, Chevrolet, Mercedes, VW, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","When I encounter a code P245F, I have discovered that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the electrical circuit of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) pressure sensor that has been given the designation B. This code should be exhibited only in vehicles that are equipped with a diesel engine.","\n ","DPF systems in OBD-II vehicles are designed to remove ninety-percent of carbon particles (soot) from diesel engine exhaust. The black smoke that billows from the exhaust of a diesel engine (under heavy acceleration) can be attributed to soot. The DPF is housed in a steel inline exhaust housing which resembles a muffler or catalytic converter. It is positioned before the catalytic converter and/or the NOx trap. Ideally, large soot particles are trapped in the DPF element. Small particles and other (exhaust gas) compounds are allowed to flow through.","A wide array of elemental compounds are used (by the DPF) to trap large soot particles and allow engine exhaust to flow through. Included are: paper fibers, metal fibers, ceramic fibers, silicone wall fibers, and cordierite wall fibers. The most common type of fiber used in DPF applications is cordierite which is ceramic based. Cordierite is inexpensive and has excellent filtration characteristics. Regrettably, Cordierite has problems with overheating at higher temperatures. This makes it susceptible to malfunctions in vehicles equipped with passive DPF systems.","The core of any DPF is the filtration element. Large particles of soot are trapped between the fibers as engine exhaust flows through the element. Exhaust pressure increases as soot is accumulated. After exhaust pressure has reached a programmed degree and an adequate amount of soot is accumulated, the filtration element must be regenerated. This allows spent exhaust gases to continue flowing through the DPF.","DPF systems are regenerated automatically are called active DPF systems. The PCM is programmed to inject chemicals (including but not limited to diesel fuel and diesel exhaust fluid) into the exhaust at programmed intervals in and active DPF system. The injection causes an increase in exhaust temperature and burns trapped soot particles; releasing them as ions of nitrogen and oxygen.","Passive DPF systems utilize a similar process but require input from the owner. In some cases, a qualified repair facility must handle the regeneration. It may take hours to complete the task once the regeneration procedure has been initiated. In some cases, the DPF must be removed from the vehicle and serviced using a specialized machine that completes the process and disposes of the soot particles appropriately.","The DPF is considered regenerated when the soot particles are sufficiently removed. Afterwards, exhaust pressure should react accordingly.","The DPF pressure sensor is usually mounted in the engine compartment and away from the DPF. Exhaust back pressure is monitored as it enters the DPF. Silicon hoses (connected to the DPF and the DPF pressure sensor) are used to accomplish this task.","A code P245F will be stored if the PCM detects an exhaust pressure condition that doesn't coincide with manufacturer’s specifications or an electrical input signal from DPF pressure sensor B which exceeds programmed limitations.\n"],"symptoms":["Diminished engine performance\nExcessive black smoke from the exhaust\nIncreased engine temperatures\nHigher than normal transmission temperatures"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Clogged DPF pressure sensor tubes/hoses\nFaulty DPF pressure sensor\nThe diesel exhaust fluid reservoir may be empty\nImproper diesel exhaust fluid\nOpen or shorted circuit/s in the DPF pressure sensor B circuit\nInept DPF regeneration\nThe active DPF regeneration system is inoperative"]}
