{"code":"P247F","description":"Exhaust Gas Temperature Out of Range Bank 2 Sensor 4","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, VW Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Chevy, Nissan, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P247F is associated with the exhaust gas temperature out of range bank 2 sensor 4 circuit. When the Engine Control Unit (ECU) detects improper signals within the exhaust gas temperature circuit code P247F will be set and the check engine light will be illuminated. Refer to a vehicle specific resource to determine which is the appropriate bank and sensor location for your particular year / make / model / engine combination.","The purpose of the exhaust gas temperature sensor is to monitor the temperature of the exhaust gases and convert it into a voltage signal that is sent to the ECU. The ECU utilizes the input to control engine conditions and effectively reduce emissions. The ECU recognizes these voltage variations and reacts accordingly, adjusting ignition timing or the air/fuel mixture to lower the exhaust gas temperature and protect the catalytic converter. Exhaust gas temperature sensors are incorporated in diesel engines, gasoline burning engines, and even turbocharged engines. This process also improves performance and fuel economy.","A typical EGT exhaust gas temperature sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine may stall\nEngine may not start\nEngine may overheat\nPoor fuel economy\nPoor performance\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective exhaust gas temperature sensor\nExcessive exhaust leak\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nExcessive carbon buildup on sensor\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty ECU"]}
