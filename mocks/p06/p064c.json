{"code":"P064C","description":"Glow Plug Control Module","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P064C means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the glow plug control module.","The glow plug control module is responsible for initiating the glow plug preheater timer and the glow plug for each individual cylinder. Glow plugs, the glow plug timer, and the glow plug controller are used exclusively in vehicles with diesel propulsion systems.","The glow plug control module may be a stand-alone module but it is most often an integral part of the PCM.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. By performing controller self-tests, the PCM can monitor serial data that is carried over the controller area network (CAN) to ensure that on-board controllers are interfacing properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the glow plug control module, a code P064C will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A typical glow plug:\n"],"symptoms":["One or more incapacitated glow plugs\nDelayed engine start-up (especially during cold weather)\nEngine stall at start-up\nEngine drivability issues\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty glow plug controller or PCM\nOpen glow plug control module voltage supply circuit\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted glow plug control circuit"],"type":"ERR"}
