{"code":"P062F","description":"Internal Control Module EEPROM Error","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Buick, Chevy, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes, Honda, Cadillac, Suzuki, Subaru, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","When a code P062F is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal performance error with the electronically erasable read only memory (EEPROM). Other controllers may also detect an internal PCM performance error (in the EEPROM) and cause a P062F to be stored.","Internal control module monitoring processors are responsible for various controller self-test duties and overall internal control module accountability. EEPROM input and output signals are subject to self-test and are monitored constantly by the PCM and other related controllers. The transmission control module (TCM), traction control module (TCSM), and other controllers also interact with the EEPROM.","In automotive applications, the EEPROM provides a means to read, erase, and rewrite small amounts (bytes) of programmable memory. Using specific programming, the EEPROM (or any portion of the EEPROM) may be erased and rewritten in sequence. The EEPROM is a bank of transistors that consists of thee parts. It is usually removable and it locks into a specially designed socket inside of the PCM. When a defective PCM is replaced, the EEPROM usually must be removed and reused in the new PCM. The EEPROM and new PCM will the need to be programmed as a unit. Even though the EEPROM is capable of more than 1-million programming changes, and is designed to last for hundreds-of-years, it can be sensitive to excessive heat and moisture.   ","Whenever the ignition is on and the PCM is energized, EEPROM self-tests are initiated. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) also compares signals from each individual module to ensure that each controller is functioning properly. These tests are performed simultaneously.","If the PCM detects discrepancies in EEPROM functionality, a code P062F will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Additionally, if the PCM detects a problem between any of the on-board controllers, which would indicate an internal EEPROM error, a code P062F will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination, depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction."],"symptoms":["Wide ranging engine/transmission drivability issues\nNo start condition\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nEngine stall or shutdown at idle\nLack of cooling fan operation"],"causes":["Defective controller or programming error\nOverheated PCM\nWater damage\nA bad controller power relay or blown fuse\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nInsufficient control module ground\nFaulty EEPROM"],"type":"ERR"}
