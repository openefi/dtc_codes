{"code":"P062B","description":"Internal Control Module Fuel Injector Control Performance","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, GMC, Chevy, Mercedes Benz, Buick, Land Rover, Mazda, Nissan, Citroen, Maserati, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","When a code P062B is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal performance error with the fuel injection control system. Other controllers may also detect an internal PCM performance error (in the fuel injection control system) and cause a P062B to be stored.","Internal control module monitoring processors are responsible for various controller self-test duties and overall internal control module accountability. Fuel injection control system input and output signals are subject to self-test and are monitored constantly by the PCM and other related controllers. The transmission control module (TCM), traction control module (TCSM), and other controllers are subject to interaction with the fuel injection control system.","Typically, the fuel injector controller is integrated into the PCM. At least one fuel injector per cylinder is used to deliver a precise amount of fuel to the cylinder at the exact instant it is required to maximize performance and efficiency.","You could think of each fuel injector as a type of solenoid that is opened or closed using battery voltage. When the ignition is ON, constant battery voltage is supplied to each fuel injector. To complete the circuit, and cause each fuel injector to spray a precise amount of fuel at the appropriate time, the PCM supplies an instantaneous ground pulse.","The PCM uses input signals from the crankshaft position (CKP) sensor, the camshaft position (CMP) sensor, the oxygen sensors, the mass airflow (MAF) sensor, and the throttle position (TPS) sensor to monitor fuel injector controller performance.","Whenever the ignition is on and the PCM is energized, fuel injection control system self-tests are initiated. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) also compares signals from each individual module to ensure that each controller is functioning properly. These tests are performed simultaneously.","If the PCM detects discrepancies in the internal fuel injector control system, a code P062B will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Additionally, if the PCM detects a discrepancy between any of the on-board controllers, which would indicate an internal fuel injector controller error, a code P062B will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination, depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction."],"symptoms":["Engine misfire\nExcessively lean or rich exhaust\nHesitation upon acceleration\nMisfire codes stored"],"causes":["Open or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nInsufficient control module ground\nDefective fuel injector/s\nDefective controller or programming error\nOpen or shorted circuits between the fuel injector and the PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
