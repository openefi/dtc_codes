{"code":"P0620","description":"Generator Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, Jeep, Cadillac, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0620 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction with the generator control circuit.","The PCM typically energizes and monitors the generator control circuit whenever the engine is running.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the generator control circuit, a code P0620 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A typical alternator:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nEngine stall when idling\nDelayed engine cranking (especially when cold)\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted generator control circuit\nFailed generator assembly\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
