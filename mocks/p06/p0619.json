{"code":"P0619","description":"Alternative Fuel Control Module RAM/ROM Error","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chrysler, Ford, Dodge, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0619 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction with the alternative fuel control module (AFCM). The issue has occurred in the random access memory (RAM)/read-only memory (ROM) portion of the AFCM.","The P0619 code is limited to vehicles that use alternative fuels such as natural gas and electricity for propulsion.","In some cases, the AFCM and PCM may be separate from one another. More often, they are integrated into a single module. This increases controller efficiency in addition to saving automakers space, time, and money.","RAM allows the PCM and other controllers to rapidly (and randomly) access bits of data needed to configure fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy in order to keep the vehicle functioning smoothly. RAM may be manipulated by the PCM an infinite number of times in order to maintain desired parameters. ROM is data memory that is monitored (read only) by the PCM for purposes of calculating various drivability functions.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring internal AFCM/PCM RAM/ROM function, a code P0619 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated,. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","Example photo of a fuel pump control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nEngine stall when idling\nDelayed engine cranking (especially when cold)\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty AFCM/PCM\nAFCM/PCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed AFCM/PCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
