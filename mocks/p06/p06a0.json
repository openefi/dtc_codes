{"code":"P06A0","description":"Variable A/C Compressor Control Circuit","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from General Motors, Honda, Dodge, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble codes P06A0, P06A1, and P06A2 are associated with the variable air conditioning (A/C) compressor control circuit.","The purpose of the variable A/C compressor control circuit is to engage and disengage the compressor at the appropriate time to maintain the desired temperature within the vehicle cabin. The ECU receives voltage signals from various components to detect possible malfunctions within the system.","The variable A/C compressor control circuit incorporates several components to accomplish this process. Most newer automobiles are equipped with climate control that is an essential component for this circuit to function properly.","When the Engine Control Unit (ECU) detects improper signals within the variable A/C compressor control circuit code P06A0 will be set and the check engine light will be activated.","A typical air conditioning compressor:\n"],"symptoms":["Air conditioner will not operate properly\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective A/C compressor\nDefective A/C solenoid (if applicable)\nLow or overcharged system\nClogged orifice tube or dryer\nMalfunctioning climate control\nDefective A/C relay\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nDefective ECU"],"type":"ERR"}
