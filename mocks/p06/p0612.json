{"code":"P0612","description":"Fuel Injector Control Module Relay Control","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevrolet, GMC, Dodge, Ram, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0612 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal control module malfunction. The issue is related to the portion of the PCM that controls the fuel injector control module relay.","In some cases, the fuel injector controller may be separate from the PCM. Most frequently, it is integrated into the PCM. This saves automakers space, time, and money.","Likewise, the fuel injector control module relay may be an integral part of the PCM or it may be a conventional relay that is located away from the PCM. Consult a reliable source of vehicle information to determine the location of the fuel injector control relay for the vehicle in question.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","In monitoring fuel injector relay control function, if the PCM detects a problem, a code P0612 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A fuel pump control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nReduced engine performance\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nDefective PCM power supply relay\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed PCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
