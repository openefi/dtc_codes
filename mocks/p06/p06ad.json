{"code":"P06AD","description":"PCM/ECM/TCM Internal Temperature Sensor B Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Mazda, Honda, Dodge, Ford, BMW, VW, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble codes P06AB, P06AC, P06AD, and P06AE are associated with the internal temperature sensor \"B\" circuit of different modules. This circuit incorporates the Power Control Module (PCM), the Engine Control Module (ECM) and/or the Transmission Control Module (TCM). Refer to a vehicle specific repair guide to determine which is the \"B\" circuit in your particular case.","The purpose of the PCM/ECM/TCM internal temperature sensor \"B\" circuit is to monitor the temperature of various sensors housed within the control modules. Malfunctions are identified through the process of control module self-test failures. On some automobiles, the three modules are integrated into one consolidated unit, normally referred to as the PCM.","When the PCM, ECM or TCM detects an electrical signal that is lower than expected (outside normal range of operation) within the internal temperature sensor \"B\" circuit, code P06AD will be set and the check engine light or the transmission warning lamp will be illuminated.","An example of a TCM transmission control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine will not start\nEngine may stall\nImproper shifting\nTransmission warning lamp illuminated\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Corroded or damaged connector\nLoose or defective control module ground strap\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nDefective PCM, ECM, or TCM"],"type":"WARN"}
