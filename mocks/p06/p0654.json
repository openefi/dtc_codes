{"code":"P0654","description":"Engine RPM Output Circuit Malfunction","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ford, GMC, Opel, Peugeot, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0654 means that the powertrain control module (PCM), or one of the other related controllers, has detected a discrepancy in the engine RPM (revolutions per minute) output circuit.","The engine RPM output circuit is responsible for providing an engine RPM output signal to the instrument panel tachometer and other controllers. The PCM receives engine RPM data from the engine camshaft and crankshaft sensors. This data is used primarily for calculating and monitoring engine drivability then output to the tachometer and other controllers (to which it is instrumental).","If a problem is detected in monitoring the engine RPM output circuit, a code P0654 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A tachometer showing engine RPM:\n"],"symptoms":["Erratic or harsh transmission shifting\nABS or TCS problems\nEngine drivability issues\nStored ABS and TCS codes"],"causes":["PCM programming error\nFaulty controller or PCM\nOpen or shorted circuit between the PCM and the instrument panel or other controllers"],"type":"ERR"}
