{"code":"P0648","description":"Immobilizer Lamp Control Circuit","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Acura, Buick, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GMC, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0648 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the immobilizer lamp control circuit.","The immobilizer lamp is contained in the instrument panel. Its primary function is to warn the driver that the immobilizer key has malfunctioned or is not recognized (when it is illuminated). This warning lamp is sometimes referred to as the security lamp.","The PCM typically monitors the continuity of the immobilizer lamp control circuit whenever the ignition is turned on. The immobilizer key is equipped with a transponder that is recognized by the PCM (and other controllers) when it is in close proximity to the vehicle. This allows various systems (such as push-to-start and keyless entry) to remain functional and practical.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) carries serial data from each individual module to ensure that on-board controllers are interfacing properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the immobilizer lamp control circuit, a code P0648 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A typical immobilizer lamp:\n"],"symptoms":["No start\nImmobilizer lamp inoperative\nOther stored (security) codes"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted immobilizer lamp control circuit\nDefective (dead battery) immobilizer key (fob)\nFailed immobilizer lamp bulb"],"type":"ERR"}
