{"code":"P0649","description":"Speed Control Lamp Control Circuit","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Jeep, Hyundai, Honda, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0649 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the speed control lamp control circuit.","The speed control lamp is contained in the instrument panel. Its primary function is to alert the driver that the speed control system has been activated (when it is illuminated). The speed control system is also called the cruise control.","The PCM typically monitors the continuity of the speed control lamp control circuit whenever the ignition is turned on. The speed control system uses input signals from the vehicle speed sensor (VSS) and/or wheel speed sensors to regulate vehicle speed automatically (after the system is activated by the driver).","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) carries serial data from each individual module to ensure that on-board controllers are interfacing properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the speed control lamp control circuit, a code P0649 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","One style of cruise control lamp indicator:\n"],"symptoms":["Speed control system inoperative\nOther stored (speed control) codes"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted speed control lamp control circuit\nDefective speed control lamp bulb"],"type":"ERR"}
