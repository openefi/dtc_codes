{"code":"P0639","description":"Throttle Actuator Control Range/Performance (Bank 2)","info":["Some newer vehicles are equipped with drive by wire systems - where the throttle body is controlled by a sensor on the gas pedal, the Powertrain Control Module / Engine Control Module (PCM/ECM), and an electric actuator motor in the throttle body.","\nÂ ","The PCM/ECM uses the Throttle position sensor (TPS) to monitor the actual throttle blade position and when the actual position is out of range with the target position, the PCM/ECM will set the DTC P0638. Bank 2 refers to the side of the engine opposite cylinder number one. It is not common to use more than one throttle body, however some manufacturers have one throttle body for each bank of the engine. All diagnostic procedures in this article specifically refer to this side of the engine only. This code is similar to code P0638, if both codes are present, suspect a wiring fault, lack of voltage or PCM/ECM issue.","Most throttle bodies of this type are not serviceable and need to be replaced. The throttle body is spring actuated to hold at an open position in the event of a motor failure, in some cases with a complete failure the throttle will be unresponsive and the vehicle will only be capable of driving at a slow speed.","Note: If there are any DTC codes associated with the throttle position sensor, be sure to correct those before diagnosing the P0639 code."],"symptoms":["Check Engine Light illuminated (Malfunction Indicator Lamp)\nThe vehicle may feel like it hesitates on acceleration"],"causes":["Pedal position sensor malfunction\nThrottle position sensor malfunction\nThrottle actuator motor malfunction\nDirty throttle body\nWiring harness, loose or dirty connections\nPCM/ECM Malfunction"],"type":"ERR"}
