{"code":"P0617","description":"Starter Relay Circuit High","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Cadillac, Nissan, Chevy, Buick, Honda, Acura, Infiniti, Peugeot, Toyota, GMC, Chevrolet, Mazda, Ford, Subaru, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","The P0617 trouble code is associated with the Starter Relay Circuit and in most circumstances the vehicle will not start. When the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) detects a malfunction within the starter relay circuit, also known as the ignition switch circuit. Several codes can be set when the PCM detects improper signals within the starter relay circuit based on the specific malfunction. This most common codes associated with this circuit are P0615, P0616 and P0617.","The purpose of the Starter Relay Circuit is to provide a power source to the starter to crank the engine and start the vehicle. Based on the specific vehicle and the drivetrain configuration several components are involved in this process. This circuit starts at the battery and includes the ignition switch, fuses, starter solenoid, starter relay and various safety devices such as clutch position sensors and neutral safety switches. ","Code P0617 is set by the PCM when it detects a high voltage situation within the starter relay circuit.","Starter relay in a Ford:\n"],"symptoms":["The engine will not start\nSporadic no-crank occurrences\nCheck Engine Light illuminated"],"causes":["Faulty ignition switch\nDefective starter relay\nFaulty starter solenoid\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nCorroded or damaged connector\nCorroded or damaged battery cable\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty PCM\nDefective starter"],"type":"WARN"}
