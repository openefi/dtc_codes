{"code":"P06B8","description":"Internal Control Module Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM) Error","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Mazda, etc.","\n ","When a code P06B8 is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal processor performance error with non-volatile access memory (NVRAM). Other controllers may also detect an internal PCM performance error (with NVRAM) and cause a P06B8 to be stored.","Internal control module monitoring processors are responsible for various controller self-test duties and overall internal control module accountability. NVRAM input and output signals are subject to self-test and are monitored constantly by the PCM and other related controllers. The transmission control module (TCM), traction control module (TCSM), and other controllers also interact with NVRAM.","In automotive applications, NVRAM is used to help retain data memory when power is shut off to the PCM. NVRAM is integrated into the PCM. Even though the NVRAM is capable of more than 1-million programming changes, and is designed to last for hundreds-of-years, it can be sensitive to excessive heat and moisture.   ","Whenever the ignition is on and the PCM is energized, NVRAM self-tests are initiated. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) also compares signals from each individual module to ensure that each controller is functioning properly. These tests are performed simultaneously.","If the PCM detects an internal discrepancy in the NVRAM processor, a code P06B8 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Additionally, if the PCM detects a problem between any of the on-board controllers, which would indicate an internal knock sensor system error, a code P06B8 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination, depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction.","Example photo of a PCM:\n"],"symptoms":["A variety of engine drivability symptoms\nOther stored diagnostic trouble codes"],"causes":["Bad PCM or a PCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
