{"code":"P069E","description":"Fuel Pump Control Module Requested MIL Illumination","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from GMC, Chevy, Buick, Cadillac, Ford, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P069E means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction with the fuel pump control module so that it has requested malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination.","The fuel pump control module is responsible for supply and regulation of voltage to the fuel pump relay and the fuel pump. Typically, the fuel pump controller is integrated into the PCM but it may also be a stand-alone module. The fuel pump provides pressurized fuel for the fuel injection system. It is most often located inside the fuel tank but may also be along the fuel rail. Diesel propulsion systems most often use high pressure pumps that are mounted on and driven by the engine.","Each time the ignition is turned on (and the PCM is energized), multiple controller self-tests are performed. The fuel pump control module is included in these controllers. By performing internal controller self-tests, the PCM can monitor serial data that is carried over the controller area network (CAN) to ensure that on-board controllers are interfacing properly.","If the fuel pump control module has requested that the MIL be illuminated, a code P069E will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated."],"symptoms":["Delayed engine starting\nNo-start condition\nEngine drivability issues\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty fuel pump controller or PCM\nOpen fuel pump control module voltage supply circuit\nBad or tripped fuel pump voltage shutoff (inertia) switch\nPCM failure or PCM programming error"],"type":"ERR"}
