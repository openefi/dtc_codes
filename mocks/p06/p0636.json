{"code":"P0636","description":"Power Steering Control Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Saturn, Renault, Dodge, Ford, Nissan, Mercedes, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble codes P0635, P0636, and P0637 are associated with the power steering control circuit.","When the Power Control Module (PCM) detects too low of voltage signals within the power steering control circuit code P0636 will be set and the check engine light will be illuminated.","The purpose of the power steering control circuit is to provide the appropriate voltage to various power steering components. The PCM monitors voltage signals from the power steering controller, sensors and switches. These components provide the proper fluid pressure within the power steering system. This process is essential to prevent damage to power steering components. The power steering control circuit facilitates the power steering system to adapt to various driving conditions and prevent Stiff or erratic steering. This circuit alerts the PCM that possible issues exist that require immediate attention.","An electric power steering motor:\n"],"symptoms":["Stiff or erratic steering\nNoise while turning\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective power steering pressure switch\nDefective power steering position switch\nFaulty power steering control\nA loose control module ground strap or broken ground wire\nInsufficient fluid level or leak\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nDefective PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
