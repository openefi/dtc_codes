{"code":"P0625","description":"Generator Field/F Terminal Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes Benz, Sprinter, Land Rover, Kia, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0625 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a lower than expected voltage signal from the generator field coil circuit. The F simply reiterates the field coil control circuit is at fault.","The field coil is probably most recognizable from its windings which are visible through the vent holes on most alternators. The field coil surrounds the generator armature and remains stationary in the alternator housing. The armature spins inside the field coil which is energized using battery voltage. Each time the engine is started, the field coil is energized.","The PCM monitors the continuity and voltage level of the generator field circuit whenever the engine is running. The generator field coil is integral to generator operation and maintaining battery charge levels.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the generator field circuit, a code P0625 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A typical alternator:\n"],"symptoms":["Charging system lamp illumination\nEngine drivability issues\nInadvertent engine shutoff\nDelayed engine cranking\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Open or shorted generator field control circuit\nBlown fuse or burnt fusible link\nDefective alternator/generator\nFaulty PCM\nPCM programming error"],"type":"WARN"}
