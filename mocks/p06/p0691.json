{"code":"P0691","description":"Cooling Fan 1 Relay Control Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) applicable to all 1996-newer vehicles. Specific repair steps can vary from make/model.","The fans that are used to cool the engines radiator are run by electric motors. These motors are turned on and off by the powertrain control module (PCM) according to the readings from the engine coolant temperature sensor (ECT). In other words when the ECT reaches a predetermined temperature the PCM turns the fans on. Then when the ECT cools to a predetermined temperature the PCM turns the fans off.","\nÂ ","The PCM controls the cooling fans by sending a ground signal to the cooling fan relay. The voltage on the signal circuit is high, around battery voltage, when not commanded on (not grounded). The opposite is true when commanded on (grounded), the voltage is somewhere near zero. DTC P0691 is set when the PCM senses the voltage low when the cooling fan 1 is off."],"symptoms":["Engine overheating\nCheck engine light on","The possibility of the engine overheating due to non-operational cooling fans is very probable so caution should be used if driving the vehicle when the conditions to set this DTC are present. It should be repaired as soon as possible."],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty cooling fan relay 1\nBlown cooling fan 1 fuse\nFaulty PCM (rarely)"],"type":"WARN"}
