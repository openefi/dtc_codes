{"code":"P063C","description":"Generator Voltage Sense Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Cummins, Land Rover, Mazda, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","The P063C OBDII trouble code is associated with the generator voltage sense circuit. When the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) detects improper signals within the generator voltage sense circuit code P063C will be set. Based on the vehicle and the specific malfunction the battery warning light, check engine light or both will be illuminated. Related codes associated with this circuit are P063A, P063B , P063C, and P063D.","The purpose of the generator voltage sense circuit is to monitor the alternator and battery voltage during vehicle operation. The output voltage of alternator must be at a level that is capable of compensating for battery draws from electrical components including the starter, lighting and various other accessories. In addition, the voltage regulator must adjust the output to provide sufficient voltage to charge the battery. ","Code P063C is set by the PCM when it detects a low voltage situation within the generator (alternator) sense circuit.","Example of an alternator (generator):\n"],"symptoms":["Battery warning lamp illuminated\nThe engine will not start\nThe engine will crank over slower than normal\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Faulty alternator\nDefective voltage regulator\nLoose or damaged serpentine belt\nDefective serpentine belt tensioner\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nCorroded or damaged connector\nCorroded or damaged battery cable\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty PCM\nDefective battery"],"type":"WARN"}
