{"code":"P068A","description":"ECM/PCM Power Relay De-Energized Performance - Too Early","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Audi, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Volkswagen, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","When a code P068A is stored, it means that the engine/powertrain control module (ECM/PCM), has detected a defect in the de-energizing procedure for the relay which supplies it with voltage. In this case the relay has de-energized too soon.","The PCM power relay is used to apply battery voltage safely to the appropriate PCM circuits. It is a contact type relay that is activated with a signal wire from the ignition switch. This relay must be gradually de-energized in a controlled manner to avoid voltage spikes and possible controller damage. This type of relay typically uses a five-wire design. Constant battery voltage is applied on one wire; ground on another. A third circuit carries a signal from the ignition switch and a fourth supplies voltage to the PCM. The fifth wire is the power relay sense circuit. It is used by the PCM to monitor power relay voltage.","If the PCM detects a malfunction in de-energizing the ECM/PCM power relay, a code P068A will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A typical PCM powertrain control module, opened up:\n"],"symptoms":["Delayed or no start\nEngine drivability issues"],"causes":["Defective PCM power relay\nBlown fuse or fusible link\nOpen or shorted circuit between the power relay and the PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
