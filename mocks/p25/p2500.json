{"code":"P2500","description":"Generator Lamp/L Terminal Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes Benz, Sprinter, Land Rover, Kia, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P2500 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a lower than expected voltage signal from the generator lamp control circuit. The L simply reiterates the lamp control circuit.","The generator lamp is contained in the instrument panel. Its primary purpose is to warn the driver of potential charging system problems, when it is illuminated.","The PCM typically monitors the continuity of the generator lamp control circuit whenever the engine is running. The generator lamp control circuit is integral to generator operation and maintaining battery charge levels.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the generator field circuit, a code P2500 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A typical alternator:\n"],"symptoms":["Charging system lamp illumination\nEngine drivability issues\nInadvertent engine shutoff\nDelayed engine cranking\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Open or shorted generator field control circuit\nBlown fuse or burnt fusible link\nDefective alternator/generator\nFaulty PCM\nPCM programming error"]}
