{"code":"P250D","description":"Engine Oil Level Sensor Circuit High","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Honda, Acura, Volvo, Fiat, Kia, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P250D and related codes P250A, P250B, P250C, P250E, and P250F are associated with the engine oil level sensor circuit. This circuit is also known as the oil level safety circuit.","The purpose of the engine oil level sensor circuit is to monitor the engine oil level and oil pressure to ensure the internal engine components are receiving the appropriate amount of lubrication. The engine oil level sensor is mounted to or inside the engine oil pan in most circumstances and the exact location is vehicle specific. This process incorporates various components to accomplish based on the configuration of the oil supply system.","When the PCM detects an unexpectedly high (above normal range) voltage or resistance within the engine oil level sensor circuit, code P250D will be set and the check engine light, service engine soon light or both may be illuminated. In some circumstances, the PCM may shut the engine down to prevent internal engine component damage.","An oil level sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine may not start\nLow oil pressure gauge reading\nService engine soon light illuminated\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective oil level sensor\nDirty or clogged oil pressure sensor\nLow engine oil level\nEngine oil level too high\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nCorroded, damaged or loose connector\nDefective fuse or fuse-able link (If applicable)\nDefective PCM"]}
