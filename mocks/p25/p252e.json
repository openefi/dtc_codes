{"code":"P252E","description":"Engine Oil Quality Circuit Intermittent/Erratic","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from General Motors, VW, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P252E and related codes P252A, P252B, P252C and P252D are associated with the engine oil quality sensor circuit.","The purpose of the oil quality sensor circuit is to send a signal to the Engine Control Module (ECM) representing the overall status of the engine oil. This circuit monitors the quality, temperature and the level of the engine oil. The engine oil quality sensor is one of the main components within this circuit and is mounted to the engine oil pan. The exact location and how the sensor functions is vehicle specific, but the purpose of this circuit is the same. Configurations will vary based on the instruments incorporated to monitor the engine oil and display the status on the dashboard to alert the driver. Some vehicles may be equipped with oil temperature, oil level and/or oil pressure gauges or readouts.","When the ECM detects voltage signals or resistance that is intermittent or erratic within the oil quality sensor circuit, code P252E will be set and the check engine light, service engine soon light or both may be illuminated. In some situations, the ECM may shut the engine down and prevent it from restarting until the issue is corrected and the code has been cleared.","An oil quality sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine may not crank over\nLow oil pressure gauge reading\nService engine soon light illuminated\nCheck engine light illuminated\nCheck Oil message on instrument cluster"],"causes":["Defective engine oil quality sensor\nLow engine oil level\nPoor quality oil\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nCorroded, damaged or loose connector\nDefective ECM"]}
