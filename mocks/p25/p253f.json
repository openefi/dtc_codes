{"code":"P253F","description":"Engine Oil Deteriorated","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Vauxhall, Mazda, Nissan, Renault, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P253F is associated with the engine oil quality. Specifically, this code indicates that the engine oil's quality is degraded to the point where it requires changing.","Mazda has this to say about the code:","The PCM calculates the traveled distance and the number of days used after reset, and determines the engine oil deterioration.\nThe PCM determines engine oil deterioration by the traveled distance of the vehicle or if the number of days used exceeds the specified value, and stores a DTC.","Some vehicles use what's called an oil life monitor (OLM) The vehicle may use an oil quality sensor or a strategy that counts the time the engine has been running (hours) and the distance driven. The vehicle's main computer called a PCM powertrain control module uses that information to determine when the oil is degraded beyond a safe limit. This OLM will tell the driver that an oil change is due at a determined interval.","You may see the check engine / service engine lamp illuminated. In addition, you may also have a warning message stating \"Oil Change Due\" or something similar."],"symptoms":["Engine may not crank over\nLow oil pressure gauge reading\nService engine soon light illuminated\nCheck engine light illuminated\nCheck Oil message on instrument cluster"],"causes":["Low engine oil level\nPoor quality oil\nOil life monitor needs to be reset\nDefective PCM strategy"]}
