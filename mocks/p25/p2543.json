{"code":"P2543","description":"Low Pressure Fuel System Sensor Circuit Intermittent","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code can typically apply to all OBDII equipped engines, but shows up more often in certain Audi, Ford and VW vehicles.","The Fuel Pressure Sensor (FPS) is usually found directly mounted into the fuel rail, close to the injectors and the intake manifold. The FPS converts the system fuel pressure into an electrical signal for the Powertrain Control Module (PCM).","\n ","The PCM receives this voltage signal and possibly one more; Fuel Temperature Sensor (FTS) which may or may not be part of the FPS. The PCM looks at the FPS sensor voltage to determine the exact amount of fuel to inject into the engine. This code is set if this input does not match normal engine operating conditions stored in the PCM’s memory, even for a second, as this diagnostic trouble code demonstrates. It also looks at the voltage signal from the FPS sensor to determine if it is correct at initial Key On.","This code could have been set because of mechanical (typically fuel pressure/volume) or electrical (fuel pressure sensor circuit) issues. These cannot be overlooked in the troubleshooting stage, especially when dealing with an intermittent problem.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of FPS/FTS sensor and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nPossible no start\nLonger than normal crank times\nHesitation during acceleration\nDecrease in fuel economy"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Open in the signal circuit to the FP sensor - possible\nShort to voltage in the signal circuit to the FP sensor - possible\nShort to ground in the signal circuit to the FP sensor - possible\nOpen in power or ground at FP sensor - possible\nFailed fuel pressure sensor - likely\nFailed PCM - unlikely"]}
