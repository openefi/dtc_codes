{"code":"P2558","description":"Engine Coolant Level Sensor/Switch Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Audi, Ford, BMW, Lincoln, Chrysler, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P2558 and related codes P2556, P2557 and P2559 are associated with the engine coolant level sensor and/or switch circuit.","Some vehicles are equipped with a coolant level sensor or switch. Typically it operates by using a float of some kind, similar to what your gas gauge sending unit uses. If the coolant level drops below a specific level, that completes the circuit and tells the PCM (powertrain control module) to set this code.","When the PCM detects voltage or resistance within the engine coolant level sensor/switch circuit that is too low below normal expected range, code P2558 will be set and the check engine or low coolant / overheating light may be illuminated."],"symptoms":["Cooling system warning lamp illuminated\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective coolant level sensor or switch\nFaulty or damaged coolant level sensor/switch wiring\nCorroded, damaged or loose connector\nDefective fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nDefective PCM"]}
