{"code":"P0496","description":"EVAP (evaporative emission) Flow During A Non-Purge Condition","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A quick search on the 'net shows that this code seems to be more common with GM (Chevy, Pontiac, etc.) vehicles. In Acura, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, and Mazda vehicles, this code is described \"EVAP system high purge flow\" which is the same thing.","\nÂ ","This DTC checks for undesired intake vacuum flow to the EVAP system. The control module seals the EVAP system by commanding the EVAP canister purge solenoid valve OFF and the EVAP canister vent solenoid valve ON. The control module monitors the fuel tank pressure (FTP) sensor to determine if a vacuum is being drawn on the EVAP system","If vacuum in the EVAP system is more than a predetermined value within a predetermined time, this code is set and the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) is illuminated."],"symptoms":[],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0496 EVAP code include:","Faulty purge or vent solenod/valve\nPlugged EVAP canister\nFailed EVAP / fuel pressure sensor\nPoor electrical connection\nShort electrical circuit condition\n(Hyundai, Isuzu)\nFaulty canister purge valve\nBlocked vapor canister\nFaulty vent solenoid\nLeaking EVAP system hose (Hyundai)\nFaulty purge flow sensor (Kia, Mazda)"],"type":"ERR"}
