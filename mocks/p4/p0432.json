{"code":"P0432","description":"Main Catalyst Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A vehicles' catalytic converter (catalyst) helps improve tailpipe emissions by oxygenating the exhaust gasses. It helps convert hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) into water vapor (H20), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and Nitrogen (N).","\nÂ ","The PCM (Powertrain control module) monitors the catalyst efficiency by means of a post-catalyst Oxygen sensor. This sensor is used primarily for this purpose. It should switch much slower than the front oxygen sensors. If at any point the PCM detects that the post-catalyst o2 sensor is switching too rapidly (indicating no change between the inlet and outlet of the catalytic converter) it interprets this as a catalyst that isn't functioning properly.","Bank 2 is the side of the engine that does *not* contain cylinder #1."],"symptoms":["Increased tailpipe emissions\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0432 code include:","Bad or non-functional catalyst\nEngine operating out of optimal air:fuel ratio"],"type":"ERR"}
