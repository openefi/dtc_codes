{"code":"P0456","description":"Evaporative Emissions System - Small leak detected","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) at different times performs various tests on the EVAP system. OBD II Enhanced EVAP systems are in place to keep fuel tank vapors from venting into the atmosphere, and instead purges them into the engine to be burned.","Regular pressure tests are conducted by the PCM to monitor the sealed system for leaks. The PCM monitors the EVAP system pressure by watching the fuel tank pressure (FTP) sensor. When the sensor indicates a small leak in the EVAP system, this code is set.","Related evaporative emission trouble codes include P0450, P0451, P0452, P0453, P0454, P0455, P0457, P0458, and P0459."],"symptoms":["There will likely be no noticeable symptoms other than the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL). This is because the EVAP system is a closed system and only controls fuel tank vapors, not engine management."],"causes":["Usually this P0456 code is caused by an incorrect or faulty gas cap. Filling the fuel tank with the engine running could conceivable cause this code as well or if the cap wasn't properly tightened. Any of the following could also be the cause:","A small leak in any of the EVAP hoses or fuel tank hoses\nA small leak in the purge valve or vent valve\nThe EVAP Canister may be leaking"],"type":"ERR"}
