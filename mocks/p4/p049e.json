{"code":"P049E","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation B Control Position Exceeded Learning Limit","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) that typically applies to OBD-II vehicles that have an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge / Ram (Cummins), Chevy / GMC (Duramax), Honda, Jeep, Hyundai, etc.","Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your OBD-II equipped vehicle has stored a code P049E, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in a certain control position of the step-down exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve. B refers to a specific position of the EGR step-down valve.","The step-down EGR valve system is designed to deliver a portion of spent exhaust gases back to the intake manifold, in measured increments, so that it can be burned a second time. This process is critical in the reduction of nitrous oxide (NOx) particles that are released into the atmosphere as a side effect of internal combustion and diesel engine operation. NOx is suspected of being a contributing factor in ozone depletion from exhaust emissions. NOx emissions are regulated by federal mandate in North American vehicles.","The learning limit is a programmed degree which reflects the minimum and maximum parameters to which a certain position (B) of the step-down EGR valve is able to adapt. If the PCM detects that the actual position of the EGR valve is beyond these parameters, a code P049E will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. In some vehicle applications, multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) are required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["There will likely be no symptoms associated with this code\nSlightly diminished fuel efficiency\nPossible drivability issues"],"causes":["Defective EGR valve\nFaulty EGR sensor\nBad PCM or a PCM programming error"],"type":"ERR"}
