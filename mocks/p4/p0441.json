{"code":"P0441","description":"Evaporative Emission Control System Incorrect Purge Flow","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","This indicates that a part of the EVAP control system is no longer functioning correctly. The EVAP system consists of many parts, including (but not limited to) the gas cap, fuel lines, carbon canister, purge valve, and other hoses. The (EVAP) emission control system prevents the escape of fuel vapors from a vehicle's fuel system. Fuel vapors are routed by hoses to a charcoal canister for storage. Later, when the engine is running a purge control valve opens allowing intake vacuum to siphon the fuel vapors into the engine.","\nÂ ","EVAP emission canister purge is controlled by a valve which allows engine vacuum to pull stored fuel vapors from fuel tank into the engine to be burned, rather than be vented to atmosphere. A vacuum switch is used to detect when flow exists. If the PCM commands purge and sees that the switch is closed (indicating no detected purge flow) P0441 is set."],"symptoms":["Likely, no symptoms will be discernible to the driver, other than the illuminated Check Engine Light."],"causes":["A code P0441 could mean one or more of the following has happened:","Bad vacuum switch\nBroken or damaged EVAP line or canister\nOpen in PCM purge command circuit\nOpen or short in Voltage feed circuit to Purge Solenoid\nFaulty purge solenoid\nRestriction in EVAP solenoid, line or canister\nCorrosion or resistance in purge connector\nBad PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
