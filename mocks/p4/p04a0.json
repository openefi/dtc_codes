{"code":"P04A0","description":"Exhaust Pressure Control Valve \"B\" Range/Performance","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to diesel engines, including but not limited to certain Ford, Dodge, Mercedes, Nissan, and VW vehicles.","This code can also apply to those trucks equipped with diesel engines and dealer installed exhaust brakes.","\nÂ ","A valve is placed in the exhaust stream after the exhaust manifold to generate heat in the form of back pressure in the exhaust. This heat and/or back pressure can be used to assist in cold start warm up. It can also be used to oppose cylinder pressure coming from the engine cylinders out of the exhaust, thereby slowing the engine down and the vehicle along with it. This is especially useful during towing operations.","This code is strictly concerned about the incoming signal from the exhaust pressure sensor not matching intake manifold pressure, ambient air pressure or preprogrammed information during normal driving. This can be a mechanical or an electrical circuit fault, depending upon vehicle manufacturer.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of exhaust back pressure control, and wire colors to the control solenoid. Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to determine which is the \"B\" valve in your particular case.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nLack of power\nLack of engine braking\nLonger than normal cold engine warmup time"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Stuck Exhaust Back Pressure Valve\nPossibly stuck / damaged / misadjusted turbocharger wastegate\nExhaust system restriction / leaks\nExhaust Gas Pressure Sensor\nPossibly the PCM has failed (highly unlikely)"],"type":"ERR"}
