{"code":"P0449","description":"Evaporative Emission Control System Vent Valve/Solenoid Circuit Malfunction","info":["This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may vary depending on the model.","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) / Engine Management Computer (EMC) / Engine Control Module (ECM) has detected a fault with the circuit that controls the vent for evaporative emission systems vapor.","\nÂ ","As fuel sits in the tank it lets out fuel vapor, while driving this vent opens and allows the vapors to be circulated into the engine intake manifold, a charcoal canister or into the atmosphere, depending on the vehicle. This vent valve is apart of the simple, yet complicated evaporative emissions system."],"symptoms":[],"causes":["Potential causes may include:","Faulty vent valve\nWire/circuit issue\nPCM/EMC/ECM fault"],"type":"ERR"}
