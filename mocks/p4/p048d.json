{"code":"P048D","description":"Exhaust Pressure Control Valve Position Sensor/Switch Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II vehicles equipped with an exhaust pressure control valve sensor or switch. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from VW, Audi, Toyota, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The exhaust pressure control valve (EPC) is a solenoid controlled valve used to regulate back pressure during cold temperatures. This helps increase cabin heat, aids in cold starting and windshield defrosting.","\nÂ ","In most cases, the powertrain control module (PCM) uses information from the exhaust back pressure sensor (EBP), intake air temperature (IAT) sensor and manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor to determine control of the valve. If the PCM detects a problem with the EPC or the IAT, it will disable the ECP. Typically, the ECP is found on diesel engines.","Code P048D is set when the PCM detects a low exhaust pressure control valve circuit signal. This usually indicates the circuit is shorted."],"symptoms":["Illuminated check engine light\nIncreased emissions\nPoor engine performance\nHard starting"],"causes":["Faulty exhaust pressure control valve\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
