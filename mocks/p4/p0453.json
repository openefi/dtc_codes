{"code":"P0453","description":"Evaporative Emissions Control System Pressure Sensor High Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The EVAP (Evaporative Emissions) System allows fuel tank vapors to be purged into the engine and burnt rather than expelled into the atmosphere as harmful emissions. The EVAP system contains a pressure sensor to check the integrity of the system.","\nÂ ","Periodically, the EVAP system performs a pressure test to check that there are no leaks in the system. It uses this sensor, also known as a fuel tank pressure (FTP) sensor to check for leaks. Basically P0453 means the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) noticed the EVAP Pressure sensor or FTP is indicating a higher than normal pressure (above 4.5 Volts) in the EVAP system. NOTE: On some vehicles the FTP is a part of the fuel pump assembly in the tank.","Related evaporative emission trouble codes include P0450, P0451, P0452, P0454, P0455, P0456, P0457, P0458, and P0459."],"symptoms":["There will likely be no noticeable symptoms along with this code other than the MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp), commonly known as Check Engine Light illumination. However, there may be noticeable fuel odors in some cases."],"causes":["A P0453 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:","Open on FTP sensor signal wire\nShort to voltage on FTP sensor signal wire\nBad FTP sensor\nAbnormally high pressure in fuel tank due to blockage in EVAP purge hoses or overfilled tank\nLoose/damaged FTP sensor connector\nLoss of ground to the sensor"],"type":"WARN"}
