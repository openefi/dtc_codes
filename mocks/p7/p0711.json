{"code":"P0711","description":"Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles which have a transmission fluid temperature sensor (Jeep, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Infiniti, Acura, Jaguar, Lexus, etc.). Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The transmission fluid temperature sensor (TFT) sensor produces a signal that is used by the powertrain control module (PCM) to determine shift points, line pressure and torque converter clutch (TCC) control. The sensor is often located in the transmission oil pan.","\nÂ ","The TFT sensor receives a reference voltage (usually 5 volts) from the PCM. It the varies its internal resistance in relation to transmission fluid temperature to send a return voltage signal to the PCM. TFT sensors are a type of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. This means internal resistance of the sensor is inversely proportional to the oil temperature. The TFT sensor signal voltage goes down when the transmission fluid temperature goes up and vice versa.","Code P0711 is set when the PCM detects a performance problem with the transmission fluid temperature sensor.","An example of a transmission fluid temperature sensor:\n","Related trans fluid temperature sensor \"A\" circuit codes:","P0710 Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor A Circuit Malfunction\nP0712 Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor A Circuit Low Input\nP0713 Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor A Circuit High Input\nP0714 Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor A Circuit Intermittent"],"symptoms":["Illuminate check engine light\nImproper torque converter clutch operation\nHarsh or delayed shifts\nVehicle stuck in limp mode"],"causes":["Faulty transmission fluid temperature sensor\nTransmission problems\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM"]}
