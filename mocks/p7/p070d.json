{"code":"P070D","description":"Transmission Fluid Level Sensor Circuit High","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a transmission fluid level sensor. Makes of vehicles may include but are not limited to GM, Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Ram, Toyota, Hyundai, etc. This code is not a common one.","The transmission fluid level (TFL) sensor is used to illuminate a warning light on the dash in the case of low fluid level.","\nÂ ","When the fluid level is within an acceptable range, the switch is grounded. When the transmission fluid drops below a predetermined level, the switch opens and a \"low transmission fluid level\" warning is displayed on the dash.","TFL sensors receive a reference voltage from the PCM. The PCM monitors the circuit and when it recognizes the switch has opened, it turns on the low fluid warning on the instrument cluster.","Code P070D is set when the PCM detects a high transmission fluid level sensor signal. This usually indicates an open circuit. Related codes include P070A, P070B, P070C, P070E, and P070F."],"symptoms":["Illuminated low transmission fluid warning light\nIlluminated check engine light\nTransmission performance problems"],"causes":["Possible causes for this code may include:","Faulty transmission fluid level sensor\nLow transmission fluid level\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM"]}
