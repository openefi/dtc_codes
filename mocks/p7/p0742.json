{"code":"P0742","description":"Torque Converter Clutch Circuit Stuck On","info":["Modern vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions / transaxles use a torque converter between the engine and transmission to increase the engine torque output and drive the rear wheels.","\nÂ ","The engine and transmission are actually connected by a fluid coupling mechanism inside of the torque converter which is what multiplies the torque until the speeds equalize and create a \"stall\" speed where the difference in actual engine RPM and transmission input RPM is around 90% efficient. Torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoids commanded by the Powertrain control module/Engine control module (PCM/ECM) or the Transmission control module (TCM) to direct hydraulic fluid and engage the torque converter clutch to create a solid coupling and increase efficiency.","The transmission control module has detected a fault with the circuit that operates the torque converter clutch solenoid.","Note: This code is similar to codes P0740, P0741, P0743, P0744, P2769, and P2770.","There may be other diagnostic trouble codes associated with the transmission control module that can only be accessed by using an advanced scan tool. If any additional transmission related DTC's appear in addition to the P0742, an electrical failure is likely."],"symptoms":["Stuck On Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated (a.k.a. Check Engine Light)\nIf the torque converter clutch is actually stuck on, the engine may stall at idle. This is a common problem for certain model GM vehicles, while driving at highway speeds and then coming to a stop the engine dies from the torque converter clutch being stuck on. Usually the engine will restart and resume normal operation."],"causes":["Wiring harness to transmission, damaged, pinched or shorted to power\nTorque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid failure\nTransmission control module (TCM)"]}
