{"code":"P0716","description":"Input/Turbine Speed Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance","info":["When a diagnostic trouble code P0716 is exhibited, it is due to the powertrain control module (PCM) detecting a malfunction in the circuit for the designated input (or turbine) speed sensor known as A. Although input and turbine speed sensors are virtually identical in design, some manufacturers choose to vary component terminology. The A designation is typically reserved for OBD-II equipped vehicles that use multiple input or turbine speed sensors.","\nÂ ","The input/turbine speed sensor is usually an electromagnetic, 3-wire sensor used to monitor transmission input speed (recognized by the PCM as revolutions per minute or RPMs). The sensor is positioned near the rear of the torque converter (at the transmission input shaft) and is either mounted with a bolt/stud or threaded directly into the transmission case.","On the transmission main (or input) shaft, specially designed grooves (or a notched reluctor wheel) are present. The input shaft (or reluctor wheel) passes in close proximity to the end of the sensor; completing the electromagnetic circuit. As the grooves (or notches) pass by the sensor, the circuit is interrupted and an electronic pattern is formed. This pattern formation is received by the PCM as a waveform pattern that it further interprets as transmission input/turbine speed.","Transmission input/turbine speed is compared with engine RPM speed, percentage of engine load, and transmission output speed to determine the desired input speed RPM. If the actual input/turbine speed fails to coincide with the desired input/turbine speed, a code will be stored and a malfunction lamp may be illuminated.\n"],"symptoms":["Speedometer and/or odometer fluctuation\nHarsh or erratic transmission shifting\nFailure of the transmission to shift at all\nPoor fuel efficiency\nIntermittent speedometer (odometer) operation\nThe engine may stall when stopping the vehicle"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Damaged, loose, or burned wiring and/or connectors\nA faulty input speed sensor\nA defective output speed sensor\nMalfunctioning transmission torque converter\nPCM failure or a PCM programming error"]}
