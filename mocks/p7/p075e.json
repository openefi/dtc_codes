{"code":"P075E","description":"Shift Solenoid G Intermittent","info":["This is a generic transmission diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission.","That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chrysler, Ford, Dodge, Hyundai, Kia, Ram, Lexus, Toyota, Mazda, Honda, VW, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","Most automatic transmissions incorporate a number of shift solenoids, depending on the number of gears inside. The trouble codes related to this, the \"G\" solenoid, are codes P075A, P075B, P075C, P075D, and P075E based on the specific malfunction that alerts the PCM to set the code and illuminate the Check Engine Light. If you have an Overdrive or other transmission warning lamp, it may be illuminated also.","The purpose of the Shift Solenoid Circuit is for the PCM to monitor the shift solenoids to manage the movement of fluid between various hydraulic circuits and change the transmission gear ratio at the appropriate time. This process maximizes the performance level of the engine at the lowest RPM possible.","The automatic transmission relies on bands and clutches to change gears and this is accomplished by having fluid pressure in the right place at the right time. The transmission solenoids are responsible for opening or closing valves in the valve body to allow transmission fluid to flow to the clutches and bands to shift the transmission smoothly as the engine accelerates.","When the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) detects a malfunction within the Shift Solenoid \"G\" Shift Circuit a variety of codes can be triggered depending on the specific vehicle, transmission and the number of gears incorporated into the specific automatic transmission. In this case, the P075E OBD-II trouble code is associated with an intermittent fault in the the transmission Shift Solenoid \"G\" Circuit.","Example of shift solenoids:\n"],"symptoms":["Transmission slipping\nTransmission overheating\nTransmission catches in gear\nDecreased fuel economy\nPossibly misfire-like symptoms\nVehicle enters limp mode\nCheck Engine Light illuminated"],"causes":["Insufficient fluid level\nDirty or contaminated fluid\nDirty or clogged transmission filter\nDefective transmission valve body\nRestricted hydraulic passages\nTransmission has internal failure\nFaulty shift solenoid\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty PCM"]}
