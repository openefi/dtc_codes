{"code":"P0720","description":"Output Speed Sensor Circuit Malfunction","info":["\nÂ ","On electronically controlled transmissions, the Output Shaft Speed Sensor (OSS) is located on the end of the transmission before the drive axles or driveshaft to read the speed of the output shaft which may be used to determine shift scheduling, torque converter engagement schedule and Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) inside the transmission. The Powertrain control module / Engine control module (PCM/ECM) has determined there is a malfunction with the OSS sensor. The PCM/ECM may substitute values based on other sensors to determine shift timing, torque converter operation and EPC pressure if the OSS sensor information is unavailable. The OSS sensor is also commonly used for the speedometer.","Note: On some vehicles, the OSS sensor is inline with the Transmission Fluid Temperature (TFT) sensor, if there is a failure with the TFT sensor or associated wiring, the OSS sensor may malfunction as well. If there is another code associated with the TFT sensor as well as the OSS sensor, suspect a possible problem with either sensor, or the wiring in between","This code is similar to codes P0721, P0722 and P0723"],"symptoms":["Delayed shifts\nSpeedometer not working\nCheck Engine Light illuminated (Malfunction Indicator Lamp)"],"causes":["Output shaft speed sensor\nElectrical wiring or connections\nTransmission fluid temperature sensor"]}
