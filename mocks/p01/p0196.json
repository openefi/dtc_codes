{"code":"P0196","description":"Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have an engine oil temperature sensor (Ford Powerstroke, Chevrolet GMC Duramax, VW, Nissan, Dodge, Jeep, Audi, etc.). Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The engine oil temperature (EOT) sensor produces a signal that is used by the powertrain control module (PCM) to calculate fuel quality, injection timing and glow plug operation. The EOT signal is also compared to other temperature sensors such as the intake air temperature (IAT) sensor and engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor for diagnostic purposes. EOT sensors are often found in diesel applications.","\nÂ ","EOT sensors receive a reference voltage (usually 5 volts) from the PCM. They then vary their internal resistance in relation to engine oil temperature to send a return voltage signal to the PCM. EOT sensors are a type of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. This means internal resistance of the sensor is inversely proportional to the oil temperature. The EOT sensor signal voltage goes down when the engine oil temperature goes up and vice versa.","Code P0196 is set when the PCM detects a performance problem with the engine oil temperature sensor sensor.","Related engine oil temperature sensor trouble codes include:","P0195 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Malfunction\nP0197 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Low\nP0198 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor High\nP0199 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Intermittent"],"symptoms":["Illuminated Check Engine Light","A typical engine oil temperature sensor:\n"],"causes":["Possible causes for this P0196 code include:","Wiring problems\nFaulty engine oil temperature sensor\nEngine cooling system problems\nFaulty PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
