{"code":"P0141","description":"O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1, Sensor 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","This code means that the heated circuit in the oxygen sensor on bank 1 decreases time needed to enter closed loop. Sensor #2 would be the second sensor downstream from the engine.","\nÂ ","As the O2 heater reaches operating temperature, the oxygen sensor responds by switching according to oxygen content of the exhaust surrounding it. The ECM tracks how long it takes for the oxygen sensor to begin switching. It the ECM determines (based on coolant temp) that too much time elapsed before the oxygen sensor began operating properly, it will set P0141. See also: P0135 (Bank 1, Sensor 1)."],"symptoms":["You will likely notice poor fuel economy the illumination of the Check Engine Light."],"causes":["A code P0141 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","open or short to ground in the wiring harness\nO2 heater circuit wiring high resistance\nO2 heater element resistance is high\nInternal short or open in the heater element","Note: Typically a failed catalytic converter does not cause this code. You're more likely to see a P0420 code for a failed converter."],"type":"ERR"}
