{"code":"P0116","description":"Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The ECT (Engine coolant temperature) sensor is a thermistor which changes resistance based on temperature of the coolant in contact with it. The ECT sensor will be located in the block or coolant passage. Usually it is a two wire sensor. One wire is a 5 Volt supply from the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) to the ECT. The other is a ground to the ECT.","\nÂ ","As the temperature of the coolant changes the resistance on the signal wire changes accordingly. The PCM monitors the reading and determines coolant temperature in order to perform essential engine fuel management. When engine coolant is low, sensor resistance is high. The PCM will see a high signal voltage (low temperature). When coolant is warm, the sensor's resistance is low and the PCM will see a high temperature. The PCM expects to see slow resistance changes on the ECT signal circuit. If it sees a quick change in voltage that isn't consistent with an engine warming up, this P0116 code will set. Or if it sees a lack of change in ECT signal, this code may set."],"symptoms":["There may be no noticeable symptoms if the problem is very intermittent, however the following may occur:","MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nPoor drivability\nBlack smoke at tailpipe\nPoor fuel economy\nMay not idle\nMay exhibit stalling or misfires"],"causes":["Potential causes of the P0116 code include:","Missing or stuck-open thermostat\nBad ECT sensor\nShort or open on signal wire\nShort or open on ground wire\nPoor connections in wiring","\nAn example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
