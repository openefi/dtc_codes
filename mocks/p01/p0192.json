{"code":"P0192","description":"Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor \"A\" Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to most fuel injected engines, both gas and diesel since 2000. The code applies to all manufacturers such as Volvo, Ford, GMC, VW, etc.","\nÂ ","This code is strictly concerned about the incoming signal from the fuel rail pressure sensor falling below a calibrated limit for a calibrated amount of time. This can be a mechanical or an electrical circuit fault, depending upon vehicle manufacturer, fuel type and fuel system.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of fuel rail pressure system, and type of fuel rail pressure sensor and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nLack of power\nEngine cranks but won't start"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","FRP signal short to SIG RTN or PWR GND\nDamaged FRP sensor"],"type":"WARN"}
