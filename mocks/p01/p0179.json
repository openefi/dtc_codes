{"code":"P0179","description":"Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit High Input","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II equipped vehicles including but not limited to Ford, BMW, Chevy, Pontiac, Mazda, VW, Honda, Scion, Land Rover, etc.","There are four trouble codes commonly associated with fuel composition sensor circuit malfunctions. This circuit is also referred to as the as the flex fuel sensor circuit and the OBDII codes that are triggered by the Engine Control Module (ECM) when this circuit malfunctions are P0176, P0177 and P0178.","\nÂ ","The fuel composition sensor circuit monitors the amount of ethanol in the gasoline on a flex fuel engine. The amount of ethanol can very every time you fill up the tank requiring appropriate adjustments for optimal performance and fuel economy. The fuel composition sensor circuit sends a signal to the ECM based on the ethanol level. The ECM adjusts the ignition timing and fuel injector pulse width accordingly to burn the fuel more efficiently. The end result is improved performance, reduced pollution and increased fuel economy.","Code P0179 is set when the ECM detects a high voltage situation within the fuel composition sensor circuit. In most circumstances the presence of a P0178 or P0179 is a very good indication that the problem is electrical in nature."],"symptoms":["Increased fuel consumption\nPoor performance\nCheck Engine Light illuminated\nEngine stalls"],"causes":["Typically, potential causes for this code include:","Faulty Fuel Cap\nContaminated fuel\nFaulty Fuel Composition Sensor\nCorroded or damaged connector\nDamaged or restricted fuel line\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty ECM"],"type":"WARN"}
