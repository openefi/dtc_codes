{"code":"P0118","description":"Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor Circuit High Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen VW, Mazda, Dodge, Ford, BW, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor is a thermistor screwed into a coolant passage in the cylinder head. Sensor resistance is high when coolant temperature is low and resistance drops when coolant temperature increases.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) provides a 5 volt reference and a ground to the sensor. The PCM monitors voltage drop to determine coolant temperature. If the ECT reads less than freezing temp. when engine has been running for more than a few minutes, the PCM determines a circuit fault and sets this code. Or if the PCM determines the sensor resistance is out of specs, this code is set.","\nAn example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor"],"symptoms":["Very poor fuel economy\nA no start condition\nVehicle may start, but run very poorly, blowing black smoke, running very rough and misfiring\nIllumination of MIL"],"causes":["A code P0118 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","A bad connection at the sensor\nAn open in the ground circuit between the ECT sensor and the PCM\nA short in the voltage feed between the sensor and the PCM\nA bad PCM (less likely)\nA bad temperature sensor (shorted internally)"],"type":"WARN"}
