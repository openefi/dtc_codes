{"code":"P0121","description":"Throttle Position Sensor/Switch A Circuit Range/Performance Problem","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The Throttle position sensor is a potentiometer that measures the amount of throttle opening. As the throttle is opened, the reading (measured in volts) goes up.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) supplies a 5 Volt reference signal to the throttle position sensor (TPS) and usually a ground also. A general measurement is: at idle = .5 Volts; full throttle = 4.5 Volts. If the PCM detects that the throttle angle is greater or less than it should be for a specific RPM, it will set this code."],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination (Check Engine Light or Service Engine Soon light)\nIntermittent stumble on acceleration or deceleration\nBlows black smoke on acceleration\nNo start"],"causes":["A code P0121 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","TPS has intermittent open or short internally\nHarness is rubbing and causing an open or short in the wiring\nBad connection at the TPS\nBad PCM (less likely)\nWater or corrosion in connector or sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
