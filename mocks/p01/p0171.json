{"code":"P0171","description":"System Too Lean (Bank 1)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. So this engine code article applies to Toyota, Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan, Honda, GMC, Dodge, etc.","Basically this means that an oxygen sensor in bank 1 has detected a lean condition (too much oxygen in the exhaust). On V6/V8/V10 engines, Bank 1 is the side of the engine that has cylinder #1. The P0171 is one of the more common trouble codes.","This code is triggered by the first downstream (front) O2 sensor. The sensor provides a reading of the air:fuel ratio leaving the engine's cylinders, and the vehicles powertrain/engine control module (PCM/ECM) uses that reading and adjusts to keep the engine running at that optimum ratio of 14.7:1. If something is not right and the PCM cannot maintain the 14.7:1 ratio, but rather there is too much air, it triggers this code.","You'll want to also read our article on short and long term fuel trims to help understand the operation of the engine. Note: This DTC is very similar to P0174, and in fact your vehicle may show both codes at the same time."],"symptoms":["You will more than likely not notice any drivability problems, although there may be symptoms such as:","a lack of power\ndetonation (spark knock)\nrough idle\nhesitation/surge on acceleration."],"causes":["A code P0171 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","The MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor is dirty or faulty\nNote: The use of \"oiled\" air filters may cause the MAF to become dirty if the filter is over-oiled. There is also an issue with some vehicles where the MAF sensors leak the silicone potting material used to protect the circuitry.\nThere could be a vacuum leak downstream of the MAF sensor\nPossible cracked vacuum or PCV line/connection\nFaulty or stuck open PCV valve\nFailed or faulty oxygen sensor (bank 1, sensor 1)\nSticking/plugged or failed fuel injector\nLow fuel pressure (possible plugged/dirty fuel filter!)\nExhaust leak between engine and first oxygen sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
