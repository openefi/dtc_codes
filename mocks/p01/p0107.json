{"code":"P0107","description":"Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit Low Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor responds to changes in the intake manifold pressure (vacuum). 5 Volts is supplied to the sensor from the PCM (powertrain control module).","\nÂ ","Inside the MAP sensor is a resistor that moves in relation to manifold pressure. The resistor varies the voltage between about 1 volt to 4.5 volts (depending on engine load) and that voltage signal is returned to the PCM to indicate manifold pressure (vacuum). This signal is essential for the PCM to determine fuel delivery. A P0107 DTC is set when the PCM sees that the MAP signal voltage is less than .25 volts which is too low.","\nA typical MAP sensor"],"symptoms":["Anytime the MAP sensor signal is low the vehicle will likely have a very difficult time starting. Other symptoms may include:","Hard to start\nLong cranking times\nSputtering/missing\nBlowing black smoke\nPoor fuel economy\nDies intermittently\nMIL(Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination"],"causes":["The causes of a low MAP sensor signal circuit (P0107) could be any of the following:","Bad MAP sensor\nOpen or short in the signal circuit\nOpen or short in the 5 Volt reference circuit\nGround circuit open or shorted\nBad PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
