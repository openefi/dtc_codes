{"code":"P0177","description":"Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) applicable to all OBD-II compatible vehicles. Specific repair steps can vary from make/model.","This trouble code that is specific to flex fuel vehicles. The fuel composition sensor is also known as a flex fuel sensor (FFS) and measures the percentage of ethanol present in the fuel being supplied to the engine.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) uses FFS information to calculate the correct air/fuel mixture and ignition timing for the best possible performance and fuel economy under all operating conditions. The FFS produces a frequency (hz) signal that is a direct reflection of the percentage of methanol in the fuel.","The higher the percentage of methanol, the higher the frequency. If the PCM receives signals from the FFS that are not within a specific range it will illuminate the check engine light and set DTC P0177.","Related fuel composition sensor circuit trouble codes include:","P0176 Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit Malfunction\nP0178 Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit Low Input\nP0179 Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit High Input"],"symptoms":["Check engine light on\nLack of Power\nPoor fuel economy\nPossible stalling at stops","If the conditions to set this code are present two key cycles in a row the PCM will limit the amount of timing advance and possibly lower the rev limiter RPM.","Due to the possibility of over working the catalytic converters, poor fuel mileage and lack of power I recommend getting this code repaired as soon as possible."],"causes":["The possible operating range of the FFS is 30hz to 145hz. The normal, or expected, operating range of the FFS is 40hz to 125hz. The FFS circuit is can be influenced by the electromagnetic interference caused by faulty secondary ignition components (i.e. spark plugs, spark plug wires, ignition coils) and aftermarket audio equipment causing a signal outside of the expected range, hence setting DTC P0177.","Potential causes for this code to set are:","Aftermarket equipment\nFaulty secondary ignition components\nFaulty FFS\nFaulty PCM (rare)"],"type":"ERR"}
