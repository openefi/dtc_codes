{"code":"P0126","description":"Insufficient Coolant Temperature for Stable Operation","info":["A P0126 diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. That means it applies to all makes/models from 1996-newer but specific troubleshooting steps may depend on the specific vehicle.","Vehicles use an engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor who's signal is used by the powertrain control module (PCM) along with other sensors to optimize the vehicle's operation. It's important for the engine to warm up and run in a particular temperature range. If the engine does not reach normal operating temperature in the expected time period, this code is triggered.","\nÂ ","Based on related discussions in our car repair forums, this particular trouble code seems to be more commonly found on Mazda vehicles, although any vehicle can experience this code. There are a few Mazda technical service bulletins (TSB) regarding this code, so if you have a Mazda, check for appropriate TSBs prior to performing diagnosis."],"symptoms":[],"causes":["A code P0126 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Low engine coolant level\nFaulty thermostat\nFaulty coolant temperature sensor (CTS)\nCTS electrical wiring or connector problem - open, short, or poor connection"],"type":"ERR"}
