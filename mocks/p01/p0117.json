{"code":"P0117","description":"Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor Circuit Low Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen VW, Mazda, Dodge, Ford, BW, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The ECT (Engine coolant temperature) sensor is a thermistor located in the engine block or other coolant passage. It changes resistance with changes in temperature of the coolant that it's in contact with. It's usually a two wire sensor. One wire is a 5 volt reference from PCM (Powertrain Control Module) and the other is a ground supplied from PCM.","\nÂ ","As the temperature of the coolant changes, the resistance of the sensor changes. When the engine is cold, the resistance is high. When the engine is warm, the resistance is low. If the PCM detects a signal voltage lower than the normal operating range of the sensor then P0117 code will set.","\nAn example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor"],"symptoms":["Potential symptoms include:","MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nPoor fuel economy\nPoor drivability\nEngine may run rough or blow black smoke out the tailpipe\nMay not idle\nMay start and then die"],"causes":["Potential causes of the P0117 code include:","Bad ECT sensor\nShort to ground on ECT signal circuit\nFaulty or damaged connectors\nWiring harness damaged\nLoose terminals at ECT or PCM\nPOSSIBLY an overheated engine\nBad PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
