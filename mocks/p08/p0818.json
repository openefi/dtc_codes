{"code":"P0818","description":"Driveline Disconnect Switch Input Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Toyota, Land Rover, Volvo, BMW, Mini, Jaguar, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0818, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the transfer case neutral safety switch (also called the shift selector switch) circuit. This type of code is applicable to vehicles with automatic AWD/4WD transmissions only.","The transfer case neutral safety switch input circuit is typically integrated into the neutral safety switch or shift selector switch. When the transfer case is placed in neutral (driveline disconnected), a voltage signal is input to the transmission control module (TCM) or the PCM. The controller also monitors transfer case neutral safety switch circuit voltage whenever the ignition is in the ON position. The TCM may be a stand alone module or part of the PCM.","If the PCM does not detect an appropriate degree of voltage on the transfer case neutral safety switch circuit, with the transfer case apparently in or neutral, a code P0818 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination.","A typical 4WD switch:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine will not start\nFront axle fails to engage or will not disengage\nEngine starts with the transmission in gear\nNo symptoms may be exhibited"],"causes":["Defective neutral safety or shift selector switch\nShorted or open wiring or connectors in transfer case neutral safety switch input circuit\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
