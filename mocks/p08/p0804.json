{"code":"P0804","description":"1-4 Upshift (Skip Shift) Lamp Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Ford, GMC, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0804, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the transmission upshift (also called skip shift) lamp control system.","The automatic transmission upshift control solenoid is used in vehicle applications where the transmission may be manually shifted through the gear range by pushing or pulling the shift lever in a singular direction. This feature is especially popular in high-performance or sports cars. Since the shifter only needs to be moved slightly, an electronic solenoid is required to input a shift signal to the TCM and effect the desired gear change. The skip shift lamp is illuminated when the driver selects the skip shift function as opposed to the conventional automatic shifter. It may also be illuminated (or flash) if a problem is detected.","The transmission control module (TCM) may be stand alone unit but is most commonly integrated into a single housing with the engine control module (ECM). This is what is referred to as the PCM.","If the PCM detects a malfunction in the upshift lamp control circuit, a code P0804 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated"],"symptoms":["Skip shift is partially or totally disabled\nSkip shift indicator lamp is inoperative, illuminated, or flashing\nThe transmission may be placed in limp-in mode"],"causes":["Defective skip shift lamp bulb\nShorted or open skip shift lamp control wiring or connectors\nController programming error"]}
