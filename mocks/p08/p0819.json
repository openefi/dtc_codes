{"code":"P0819","description":"Up and Down Shift Switch to Transmission Range Correlation","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from VW, Audi, Honda, Ford, Kia, Lincoln, Hyundai, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\n ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0819, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction between the upshift/downshift switch and the transmission range (shift range) switch. This type of code is usually limited to vehicles with automatic transmissions and paddle or sport shifters.","The transmission control module (TCM) may be a stand alone module or part of the PCM. Upshift/downshift (paddle) shifter buttons are typically located on the steering wheel horn pad in close proximity to the driver’s finger position. They are used as a type of sport shifter, usually in high-performance models. The PCM monitors the transmission range switch to ensure that gear selection is consistent with upshift/downshift switch input signals. Additionally, the PCM monitors upshift/downshift switch and transmission range circuit voltage to ensure that both are within established parameters.","If the PCM detects that the transmission gear selection is not consistent with the gear selection signal input by the upshift/downshift switch or if circuit voltage is not within allowable parameters, a code P0819 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Manual (paddle) upshift/downshift function disabled\nShift indicator reflects incorrect gear\nNo symptoms may be exhibited"],"causes":["Defective upshift/downshift switch\nBad transmission (shift) range sensor\nShorted or open circuits in upshift/downshift or transmission range switch circuit\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
