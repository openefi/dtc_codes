{"code":"P0803","description":"1-4 Upshift (Skip Shift) Solenoid Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Ford, GMC, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0803, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the transmission upshift (also called skip shift) solenoid control system.","The automatic transmission upshift control solenoid is used in vehicle applications where the transmission may be manually shifted through the gear range by pushing or pulling the shift lever in a singular direction. This feature is especially popular in high-performance or sports cars. Since the shifter only needs to be moved slightly, an electronic solenoid is required to input a shift signal to the TCM and effect the desired gear change.","The transmission control module (TCM) may be stand alone unit but is most commonly integrated into a single housing with the engine control module (ECM). This is what is referred to as the PCM.","If the PCM detects a malfunction in the upshift solenoid control circuit, a code P0803 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated"],"symptoms":["Skip shift is partially or totally disabled\nSkip shift indicator lamp is illuminated or flashing\nThe transmission may be placed in limp-in mode"],"causes":["Defective skip shift solenoid\nShorted or open skip shift solenoid control wiring or connectors\nController programming error"]}
