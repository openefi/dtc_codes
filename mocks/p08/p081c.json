{"code":"P081C","description":"Park Input Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Land Rover, Volvo, BMW, Mini, Jaguar, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P081C, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the PARK input circuit of the neutral safety switch (also called the shift selector switch). This type of code is applicable to vehicles with automatic transmissions only.","The PARK input circuit is typically integrated into the neutral safety switch or shift selector switch. When the transmission is placed in PARK, a voltage signal is input to the transmission control module (TCM) or the PCM. The controller also monitors circuit voltage whenever the ignition is in the ON position. The TCM may be a stand alone module or part of the PCM.","If the PCM does not detect an appropriate degree of voltage on the PARK circuit, with the transmission apparently in park or neutral, a code P081C may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Engine will not start\nEngine starts with the transmission in gear\nNo symptoms may be exhibited"],"causes":["Defective neutral safety or shift selector switch\nShorted or open wiring or connectors in PARK input circuit\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
