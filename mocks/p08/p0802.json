{"code":"P0802","description":"Transmission Control System MIL Request Circuit/Open","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevrolet, Kia, GMC, Dodge, Ford, Ram, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0802, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has received a data input signal indicating that the transmission control system (TCS) has detected a malfunction which requires malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination.","The transmission control module (TCM) may be stand alone unit but is most commonly integrated into a single housing with the engine control module (ECM). This is what is referred to as the PCM.","The PCM utilizes input signals from multiple engine and transmission sensors to calculate automatic transmission shift strategy. A high pressure pump (inside the transmission) forces fluid through the valve body and into the sprag assembly; in addition to lubricating and cooling the transmission. The high pressure fluid allows the clutches to separate from the sprag momentarily so that the gear ratio may be changed smoothly. One or more electronic pressure control (EPC) solenoids help to regulate fluid pressure. Electronic pressure (EP) sensors provide the PCM with pertinent data regarding fluid pressure at various points in the transmission. Electronic shift solenoids are used to interrupt the flow of high pressure fluid so that the transmission shifts gears when commanded. The PCM uses voltage input signals from the transmission input speed sensor and transmission output speed sensor to determine if the transmission is shifting efficiently.","As with many other automatic transmission malfunctions, a transmission control system code may be caused by either an electrical or mechanical failure. If the PCM detects a malfunction which demands MIL illumination, a code P0802 will be stored and a MIL illuminated","A typical transmission control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Erratic or harsh shifting\nDelayed or no gear engagement\nThe transmission may be placed in limp-in mode"],"causes":["Defective TCM or PCM\nShorted or open transmission control circuits\nController programming error"]}
