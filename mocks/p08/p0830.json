{"code":"P0830","description":"Clutch Pedal Switch A Circuit","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II vehicles equipped with a clutch pedal. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Jaguar, Dodge, Chrysler, Chevy, Saturn, Pontiac, Vauxhall, Ford, Cadillac, GMC, Nissan, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The P0830 OBD-II trouble code is associated with the Clutch Pedal Switch \"A\" Circuit. When the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) detects a malfunction within the Clutch Pedal Switch \"A\" Circuit, also known as the clutch position sensor or clutch start switch circuit a number of different codes can be set.","\nÂ ","These codes are P0830, P0831, P0832, P0833, P0834, P0835 and P083F based on the specific malfunction that alerts the PCM to set the code and illuminate the Check Engine Light.","The purpose of the Clutch Pedal Switch \"A\" Circuit is for the PCM to monitor the position of the clutch pedal. This process is accomplished by reading the output voltage of the clutch position sensor. The clutch position sensor switch may vary in design from one vehicle to another, it is usually a basic \"on/off\" switch mounted near the clutch foot pedal on the support bracket. Regardless of the design, constant voltage is typically present on one side of the switch and the contacts are closed by engaging the clutch pedal transferring voltage to the starter or starter solenoid. This basic circuit and switch prevents starting the engine prior to engaging the clutch.","Code P0830 Clutch Pedal Switch A Circuit is set by the PCM when the Clutch Pedal Switch \"A\" Circuit is open or has a general malfunction."],"symptoms":["The engine will not start\nThe engine will start without engaging the clutch\nCheck Engine Light illuminated"],"causes":["Faulty clutch position sensor switch\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nCorroded or damaged connector\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty PCM"]}
