{"code":"P0817","description":"Starter Disable Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Volkswagen, Audi, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","If your vehicle has stored a code P0817, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the starter disable switch circuit. This type of code may be applicable to vehicles with manual or automatic transmissions.","The starter disable switch is usually a single circuit, open/closed switch which interrupts voltage between the ignition switch and the starter solenoid if the clutch is not depressed, the transmission (manual) is not in neutral, or the transmission (automatic) is not in park. Vehicle applications with an automatic transmission may have the starter disable switch integrated into the neutral safety switch or shift selector switch. The transmission control module (TCM) or the PCM monitor starter disable circuit voltage with the ignition in the ON position. The TCM may be a stand alone module or part of the PCM.","If the PCM detects that starter disable switch circuit voltage is not within allowable parameters, a code P0817 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Engine will not start\nEngine starts with the transmission in gear\nNo symptoms may be exhibited"],"causes":["Defective starter disable switch\nShorted or open wiring or connectors in starter disable switch circuit\nFaulty PCM or a programming error"]}
