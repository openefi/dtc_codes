{"code":"P0298","description":"Engine Oil Over Temperature Condition","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means it applies to most OBD-II equipped vehicles including but not limited to Ford, Nissan, Suzuki, Dodge, Chevrolet, Jeep, Subaru, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A stored code P0298 indicates that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an engine oil temperature that is higher than acceptable. The conditions which contribute to a code of this nature being stored may be electrical or mechanical.","\nÂ ","Not every vehicle is equipped with a system that monitors oil temperature. Personally, I have only encountered oil temperature monitoring systems on diesel applications. Engine oil temperature sensors are typically negative coefficient thermistors which decrease circuit resistance as oil temperature is elevated. The oil temperature monitoring circuit begins with a reference voltage signal (usually 5-volts), applied to the sensor. When engine oil is at or near ambient temperature, oil temperature sensor resistance is high and that keeps oil temperature sensor circuit voltage low (normally near .5-volts).","As oil temperature increases, and sensor resistance decreases, circuit voltage becomes greater. The PCM is programmed to recognize these variations in sensor circuit voltage as varying degrees of oil temperature. In some cases, the engine oil temperature sensor also provides an engine oil temperature gauge with an electrical signal that is displayed on the instrument panel for driver convenience.","If the PCM detects a level of engine oil temperature sensor circuit voltage that is not within the programmed parameters, a code P0298 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.","A typical engine oil temperature sensor:\n","This code belongs in the P0200-P02FF batch of diagnostic codes. Related engine oil temperature sensor codes include P0195, P0196, P0197, P0198, and P0199."],"symptoms":["Unusual engine noises and/or smells\nEngine coolant leaks\nDiminished engine performance\nEngine cooling system codes"],"causes":["Possible causes for this P0298 code may include:","An engine cooling system condition that has resulted in engine overheating\nDefective engine oil temperature sensor\nOpen or shorted circuit\nCorroded wiring and/or connectors\nLow oil level"],"type":"ERR"}
