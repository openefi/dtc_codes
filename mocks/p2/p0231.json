{"code":"P0231","description":"Fuel Pump Secondary (Feedback) Circuit Low Voltage","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The fuel pump is powered by the fuel pump relay. When the PCM (powertrain control module) activates the fuel pump relay, voltage is supplied to the fuel pump and it pressurizes the fuel system. Some vehicles have a feedback on the fuel pump supply circuit. This is simply a circuit spliced into the voltage feed to the fuel pump. The splice is usually located close to the PCM.","\nÂ ","The PCM monitors this feedback circuit to ensure that there is proper voltage being sent to the fuel pump. As it activates the fuel pump relay, it expects to see battery voltage on the feedback circuit. If it sees voltage that is too low or no voltage at all, it may set P0231."],"symptoms":["No start Start and stall\nMisfire\nInadequate fuel supply"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0231 code include:","Bad FP (fuel pump) relay\nHarness chafing causing open in fuel pump supply circuit\nLoose/damaged connectors\nOpen in feedback circuit\nFuel pump fuse blown due to short to ground","NOTE: If no drivability complaints are present and P0231 code is stored, suspect open in feedback circuit between splice and PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
