{"code":"P0200","description":"Injector Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","In sequential fuel injection the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) controls each injector individually. Battery voltage is supplied to each injector from, usually, the power distribution center (PDC) or other fused source.","\nÂ ","The PCM supplies the ground circuit to each injector by means of an internal switch called a \"driver\". The PCM monitors each driver circuit for faults. For example, when a fuel injector is commanded \"off\" by the PCM, it expects to see a high voltage on the driver ground circuit. Conversely, when a fuel injector is commanded \"on\" by the PCM, it expects to see the voltage pulled low on the driver circuit","If it doesn't see this expected condition on the driver circuit, P0200 or P1222 may set. Other injector circuit fault codes may set as well."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine misfire at idle or at highway speed\nEngine may start and stall or not start at all\nCylinder misfire codes may be present"],"causes":["Potential causes of an P0200 code include:","Open or shorted injector\nInjector low internal resistance (basically an injector that works, but is out of specs)\nGrounded driver circuit\nOpen driver circuit\nDriver circuit shorted to voltage\nWiring harness intermittently shorting against underhood components"],"type":"ERR"}
