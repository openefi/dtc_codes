{"code":"P0219","description":"Engine Overspeed Condition","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Honda, Acura, Chevrolet, Mitsubishi, Dodge, Ram, Mercedes-Benz, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","When a code P0219 is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected that the engine has been operated at a level of revolutions per minute (RPM) which exceeds the maximum threshold.","The PCM uses input signals from the crankshaft position sensor (CKP), camshaft position sensor (CMP), and the transmission output speed sensor/s to establish whether (or not) an engine overspeed condition has occurred.","In most cases, the overspeed condition will be automatically met with a rev-limiting device when the transmission is in neutral or park. When the PCM detects an overspeed condition, one of several courses of action may be taken. Either the PCM will discontinue fuel injector pulse and/or retard ignition timing to decrease engine RPM until they return to an acceptable level.","If the PCM is unable to effectively return the engine RPM to an acceptable level, within a certain period of time, a code P0219 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated."],"symptoms":["There will likely be no drivability symptoms associated with a stored code P0219\nThe engine may be allowed to over-rev repeatedly\nKnock sensor activation/knock sensor codes\nClutch slippage (vehicles with manual transmissions)"],"causes":["Driver error from deliberate or accidental over revving of the engine\nDefective CKP or CMP sensor\nBad transmission input or output speed sensor\nOpen or shorted circuit in the CKP, CMP, or transmission input/output speed sensor system\nFaulty PCM or a PCM programming error"],"type":"ERR"}
