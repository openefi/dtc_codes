{"code":"P2158","description":"Vehicle Speed Sensor \"B\" Malfunction","info":["Basically this P2158 code means that the vehicle's speed as read by the Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) \"B\" is not as expected (malfunctioned). The VSS input is used by the vehicle's main computer called a PCM/ECM powertrain/engine control module along with other inputs for proper operation of the vehicle systems.","\nÂ ","Typically, the VSS is an electromagnetic sensor that uses a rotating reluctor ring to complete an input circuit to the PCM. The VSS is mounted in the transmission housing at such a position as to allow the reluctor ring to pass by it; in close proximity. The reluctor ring is attached to the output shaft of the transmission so that it spins along with it. As the reluctor ring passes by the electromagnetic tip of the VSS, notches and grooves serve to complete and interrupt the circuit rapidly. These circuit manipulations are recognized by the PCM as transmission output speed or vehicle speed.","A typical VSS or vehicle speed sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["loss of anti-lock brakes\nthe \"anti-lock\" or \"brake\" warning lamps on the dash may be lit\nthe speedometer or odometer may not work properly (or at all)\nyour vehicle's RPM limiter may be decreased\nthe shifting of an automatic transmission may become erratic\nother symptoms may also be present"],"causes":["A code P2158 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","The Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) \"B\" is not reading (functioning) properly\nThere is a broken/frayed wire leading to the vehicle speed sensor\nThe vehicle's PCM is not correctly configured for the actual tire size on the vehicle"]}
