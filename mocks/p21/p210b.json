{"code":"P210B","description":"Throttle Actuator B Control Motor Circuit Range Performance","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBDII equipped engines with electric Throttle Actuators, but shows up more often in certain Ford and Nissan vehicles.","The Throttle Actuator B (TA-B) is can usually be found mounted to the front of the engine, on top of the engine, inside the wheel wells or against the bulkhead. The TA-B is operated by an electrical signal from the Powertrain Control Module (PCM).","\nÂ ","The PCM receives inputs to determine when and how long it needs to operate the TA-B. These inputs are voltage signals received from coolant temp, intake air temp, engine rpm and air conditioning system pressure sensors. Once the PCM has received these inputs it can modify the signal to the TA-B.","P210B is typically set because of electrical (TA-B circuit) issues but can be caused by mechanical issues, such as a mechanically stuck throttle blade on the electrically driven Throttle Actuator. Both electrical and mechanical issues cannot be overlooked in the troubleshooting stage, especially when dealing with an intermittent problem.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of TA-B and wire colors.","Related throttle actuator B control motor circuit codes:","P210A Throttle Actuator \"B\" Control Motor Circuit Open\nP210C Throttle Actuator \"B\" Control Motor Circuit Low\nP210D Throttle Actuator \"B\" Control Motor Circuit High"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nFixed idle speed\nUnable to accelerate engine"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Open or short in the circuit to the Throttle Actuator - likely\nFailed Throttle Actuator - inoperative (mechanically or electrically) - likely\nFailed PCM - unlikely"]}
