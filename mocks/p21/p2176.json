The PCM sets these when other codes are present that indicate an issue that may be safety related or cause damage to the engine or drivetrain components if not corrected in a timely manner.","Code P2176 is set by the PCM in the situation where the idle position is not learned within the throttle actuator control system.","The Throttle Actuator Control System is duty cycle controlled by the PCM and the function of the system is limited when other fault codes are detected."],"symptoms":["Engine will not start\nLittle or no throttle response\nCheck Engine Light illuminated\nABS Light illuminated\nAutomatic transmission will not shift\nAdditional codes are present"],"causes":[]}
