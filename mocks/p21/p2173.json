{"code":"P2173","description":"Throttle Actuator Control System - High Air Flow Detected","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II equipped vehicles that use a drive-by-wire throttle control system including but not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, Volvo, Fiat, Mitsubishi, etc.","The P2173 OBD-II trouble code is one of number of possible codes that indicates that the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the operation of the Throttle Actuator Control System.","\nÂ ","The PCM sets these when other codes are present that indicate an issue that may be safety related or cause damage to the engine or drivetrain components if not corrected in a timely manner. This and related codes (P2172, P2173, P2174, and P2175) all indicate detected air flow problems.","Code P2173 is set by the PCM when high air flow is detected in the throttle actuator control system.","This code can be related to a Throttle Actuator Control System malfunction, but it is possible that another issue is setting this code. The Throttle Actuator Control System is duty cycle controlled by the PCM and the function of the system is limited when other fault codes are detected.","Note: In the case of certain Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler vehicles, this code may be described as \"High Airflow/Vacuum Leak Detected (Slow Accumulation)\""],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) or ABS warning lamp illumination\nEngine may not start\nEither no or low throttle response\nAutomatic transmission will not shift\nAdditional codes are possibly set"],"causes":["Potential causes of the P2173 throttle engine code may include:","Engine Overheating\nVacuum Leaks (likely on Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep brand vehicles)\nManifold Absolute Pressure Malfunction\nAbnormal System Voltages"]}
