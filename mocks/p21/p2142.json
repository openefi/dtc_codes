{"code":"P2142","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation Throttle Position Control Circuit \"A\" High","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. Vehicle brands may include but are not limited to Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GM, Chevy, etc.","This exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) throttle control valve is placed in between the intake manifold and the air filter, similar to a throttle body. It is used to create a small vacuum that will draw exhaust gases into the intake manifold.","\n ","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) tells the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) throttle control valve where to position itself. This code is looking at the voltage signals from the EGR throttle control valve to determine if they are correct based on inputs to the PCM. This code could have been set most likely due to electrical issues. In this case, P2142 refers to a high electrical condition on that control circuit.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of EGR throttle control valve and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nLonger than normal active aftertreatment regeneration times (it will take longer for the exhaust system to get hot and burn off the soot that has built up inside the diesel particulate filter/catalytic converter)"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Short to voltage in the signal circuit to the EGR throttle control valve\nGeneral electrical problem within the circuit to the EGR throttle control valve\nEGR throttle control valve faulty – internally shorted\nFailed PCM - unlikely"]}
