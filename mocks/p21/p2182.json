{"code":"P2182","description":"Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor 2 Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is considered generic because it applies to all 1996-newer OBD-II equipped vehicles (e.g. Vauxhall, VW, Ford, Dodge, etc.). Specific troubleshooting and repair steps may vary slightly depending on make/model.","The ECT (Engine coolant temperature) sensor is basically a thermistor that changes resistance with temperature. Usually a two wire sensor, a 5 volt reference from PCM (Powertrain Control Module) and ground signal to PCM. This is different from a temperature SENDER (which usually operates the dash temperature gauge and operates in a similar way as the SENSOR, only it's a different circuit than what a P2182 is referring to).","\nÂ ","As the temperature of the coolant changes, the resistance changes on the ground signal to the PCM. When the engine is cold, the resistance is high. When the engine is warm, the resistance is low. If the PCM detects a voltage condition that seems abnormally low or high, P2182 will set.","\nAn example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor","Note: This DTC is basically identical to P0115, however the difference with this code is that this refers to the #2 ECT circuit. So vehicles exhibiting this code means they have two ECT sensors. Be sure you are diagnosing the correct sensor circuit."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination will always occur\nVehicle may be hard to start\nMay blow a lot of black smoke and run extremely rich\nEngine may want to die or backfire in tailpipe\nEngine may run lean and increased Nox emissions may be apparent (Requires gas analyzer)\nCooling fans may run all the time when they shouldn't be, or not at all when they should be"],"causes":["Usually the cause can be traced to a bad ECT sensor, however that doesn't preclude the following:","Wiring or connector damaged at #2 ECT sensor\nOpen or short in reference or signal circuit\nOpen or short in ECT #2 signal circuit\nBad PCM"]}
