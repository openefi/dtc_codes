{"code":"P2102","description":"Throttle Actuator A Control Motor Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBDII equipped engines with electric Throttle Actuators, but shows up more often in certain Ford and Nissan vehicles.","The Throttle Actuator A (TA-A) is can usually be found mounted to the front of the engine, on top of the engine, inside the wheel wells or against the bulkhead. The TA-A is operated by an electrical signal from the Powertrain Control Module (PCM).","\nÂ ","The PCM receives inputs to determine when and how long it needs to operate the TA-A. These inputs are voltage signals received from coolant temp, intake air temp, engine rpm and air conditioning system pressure sensors. Once the PCM has received these inputs it can modify the signal to the TA-A.","P2102 is typically set because of electrical (TA-A circuit) issues. These cannot be overlooked in the troubleshooting stage, especially when dealing with an intermittent problem.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of TA-A and wire colors.","Related throttle actuator A control motor circuit codes:","P2100 Throttle Actuator \"A\" Control Motor Circuit Open\nP2101 Throttle Actuator \"A\" Control Motor Circuit Range/Performance\nP2103 Throttle Actuator \"A\" Control Motor Circuit High"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nFixed idle speed\nUnable to accelerate engine"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Open or short in the circuit to the Throttle Actuator - likely\nFailed Throttle Actuator - likely\nFailed PCM - unlikely"]}
