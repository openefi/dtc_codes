{"code":"P2185","description":"Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor #2 Circuit High Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (VW, Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor is a thermistor screwed into a coolant passage in the cylinder head. Sensor resistance is high when coolant temperature is low and resistance drops when coolant temperature increases.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) provides a 5 volt reference and a ground to the sensor. The PCM monitors voltage drop to determine coolant temperature. If the ECT reads less than freezing temp. when engine has been running for more than a few minutes, the PCM determines a circuit fault and sets this code. Or if the PCM determines the sensor resistance is out of specs, this code is set.","\nAn example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor","Note: This DTC is basically identical to P0118, however the difference with this code is that this refers to the #2 ECT sensor circuit. So vehicles exhibiting this code means they have two ECT sensors. Be sure you are diagnosing the correct sensor circuit."],"symptoms":["Very poor fuel economy\nA no start condition\nVehicle may start, but run very poorly, blowing black smoke, running very rough and misfiring\nIllumination of MIL"],"causes":["A code P2185 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","A bad connection at the #2 ECT sensor\nAn open in the ground circuit between the #2 ECT sensor and the PCM\nA short in the voltage feed between the sensor and the PCM\nA bad PCM (less likely)\nA bad temperature sensor (shorted internally)"]}
