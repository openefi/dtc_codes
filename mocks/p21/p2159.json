{"code":"P2159","description":"Vehicle Speed Sensor \"B\" Range/Performance","info":["Basically a P2159 trouble code means that the vehicle's speed as read by the Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) \"B\" is outside of the expected range (too high or low for example). The VSS input is used by the vehicle's main computer called a PCM/ECM powertrain/engine control module along with other inputs for proper operation of the vehicle systems.","\nÂ ","How The VSS Works","Typically, the VSS is an electromagnetic sensor that uses a rotating reluctor ring to complete an input circuit to the PCM. The VSS is mounted in the transmission housing at such a position as to allow the reluctor ring to pass by it; in close proximity. The reluctor ring is attached to the output shaft of the transmission so that it spins along with it.","As the reluctor ring passes by the electromagnetic tip of the VSS, notches and grooves serve to complete and interrupt the circuit rapidly. These circuit manipulations are recognized by the PCM as transmission output speed or vehicle speed.","A typical VSS or vehicle speed sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["This code is different from the P2158 code in the fact that it may not trigger the malfunction indicator light (MIL). Potential symptoms are basically the same as the P0500 VSS code:","loss of anti-lock brakes\nthe \"anti-lock\" or \"brake\" warning lamps on the dash may be lit\nthe speedometer or odometer may not work properly (or at all)\nyour vehicle's RPM limiter may be decreased\nthe shifting of an automatic transmission may become erratic\nother symptoms may also be present"],"causes":["A P2159 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:","The Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) \"B\" is not reading (functioning) properly\nThere is a broken/frayed wire leading to the vehicle speed sensor\nThe vehicle's PCM is not correctly configured for the actual tire size on the vehicle"]}
