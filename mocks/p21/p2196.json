{"code":"P2196","description":"O2 A/F Sensor Signal Biased/Stuck Rich (Bank 1 Sensor 1)","info":["This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model.","On some vehicles, such as Toyotas, this is actually referring to A/F sensors, Air/Fuel ratio sensors. Which are basically more sensitive versions of oxygen sensors.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust using oxygen (O2) sensors, and tries to keep things at the normal air/fuel ratio of 14.7:1 via the fuel system. The oxygen A/F sensor outputs a voltage reading that the PCM uses. This DTC is set when the air/fuel ratio as read by the PCM has strayed so far from 14.7:1 that the PCM can no longer correct it.","This code specifically refers to the sensor between the engine and catalytic converter (not the one behind it). Bank #1 is the side of the engine that contains cylinder #1.","Note: This DTC is very similar to P2195, P2197, P2198. If you have multiple DTC codes, always fix them in the order they appear."],"symptoms":["For this DTC, the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will illuminate. There may be other symtoms."],"causes":["Potential causes of a P2196 code include:","Oxygen (O2) or A/F ratio sensor or sensor heater malfunction\nOpen or short in O2 sensor circuit (wiring, harness)\nFuel pressure or fuel injector problem\nFaulty PCM\nIntake air or engine vacuum leaks\nFaulty fuel injector(s)\nFuel pressure too high or too low\nPCV system leak/fault\nA/F sensor relay faulty\nMAF sensor malfunction\nECT sensor malfunction\nAir intake restriction\nFuel pressure too high\nFuel pressure sensor malfunction\nFuel pressure regulator malfunction\nNote on some vehicles that have been modified this code may be caused by the modifications (e.g. aftermarket exhaust, headers, etc.)."]}
