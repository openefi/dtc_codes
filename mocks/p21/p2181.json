{"code":"P2181","description":"Cooling System Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. The code may be seen on Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, and other models.","Unlike most generic-computer fault codes that are relatively specific as to the items or area the fault occurred, code P2181 is vague to say the least. The fault is recognized and set if the engine temperature is out of range either too hot or cold.","\nÂ "],"symptoms":["The engine temperature gauge indicates a higher or lower than normal temperature. If the vehicle has no temperature gauge it will have a \"red\" temperature warning light, which means the engine is already overheating and must be shut down immediately.\nIn the event the gauge is faulty or goes unnoticed, an overheating engine will cause the coolant to boil producing steam, the radiator/tank will overflow, and in the critical stages the engine will begin to knock, lose power and finally seize.\nIf the engine is running cold, the fuel mixture will be rich, resulting in poor fuel economy, the heater will not function well and the temperature gauge will indicate colder than normal. All engines are designed to expand to a predetermined point as they heat up. It is critical to maintain the proper operating temperature for proper sealing of the piston rings."],"causes":[]}
