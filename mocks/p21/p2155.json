{"code":"P2155","description":"Fuel Injector Group D Circuit/Open","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge Ram (Cummins), GMC Chevrolet (Duramax), VW, Audi, Ford (Powerstroke), Mercedes Sprinter, Peugeot, Alfa Romeo, Nissan, Saab, Mitsubishi, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","Fuel injectors are an integral part of the fuel delivery systems in modern day vehicles.","\nÂ ","Fuel delivery systems use varying amounts of components to control and monitor the volume, timing, pressures, etc. of the system in conjunction with the ECM (Engine Control Module). Fuel injectors were introduced as a replacement to the carburetor because injectors are more efficient and effective in controlling fuel delivery. As a result, they have improved our fuel economy, and engineers have been actively designing more ideal ways to increase efficiency to this design.","Given the fact that the injector's spray is controlled electronically, supply voltage is crucial in supplying fuel to the cylinders. That said, a problem in this circuit can and/or will cause significant drivability issues among other potential hazards/symptoms.","The group letter \"D\" in this code is used to distinguish what exact circuit the fault is referring to. To determine how this applies to your particular vehicle, you will need to refer to manufacturer specific technical information. Some examples of distinctions with injectors: Bank 1, 2, etc., paired injectors, individual injectors, etc.","The ECM illuminates the MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) with P2155 and/or related codes (P2156, P2157) when it monitors a fault within the supply voltage to the fuel injectors and/or their circuits. The fact that the fuel injectors' harnesses are routed in close proximity to extreme temperatures should be noted. Because of the location of the harnesses, they are volatile to physical damage. With this in mind, I will say, most of the time, this will be a mechanical issue.","The P2155 Fuel Injector Group D Circuit/Open code is active when the ECM detects a open or malfunction within the fuel injector's supply voltage circuit."],"symptoms":["Erratic engine performance\nMisfire\nFuel economy reduced\nErratic idle\nExcessive smoke\nEngine noise(s)\nLack of power\nCannot climb steep hills\nReduced throttle response"],"causes":["Defective or damaged fuel injector(s)\nDamaged wiring harness\nInternal wiring malfunction\nInternal ECM issue\nConnector problem"]}
