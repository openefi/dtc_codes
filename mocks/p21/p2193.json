{"code":"P2193","description":"System Too Lean At Higher Load Bank 2","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to fuel injected engines from most European and Asian manufacturers since 2010.","Those manufacturers include but are not limited to Volkswagen, Audi, Mercedes, BMW/Mini, Hyundai, Mazda, Kia and Infiniti.","\n ","This code is mostly concerned about the value provided by the air/fuel ratio sensor, more commonly called an oxygen sensor (located in the exhaust) which helps the vehicle’s PCM (powertrain control module) control the amount of fuel being injected into the engine. Specifically, the PCM is detecting a lean condition which means too much air in the air/fuel ratio. This code is set for Bank 2, which is the bank of cylinders that does not include cylinder number 1. This can be a mechanical or an electrical circuit fault, depending upon vehicle manufacturer and fuel system.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of fuel system, type of mass airflow sensor (MAF) and wire colors and type of air/fuel ratio sensor/oxygen sensor (AFR/O2) and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nLack of power\nOccasional misfire\nPoor fuel economy"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty air/fuel ratio sensor/oxygen sensor (AFR/O2)\nFaulty mass airflow sensor (MAF)\nRarely - faulty Powertrain Control Module (PCM)"]}
