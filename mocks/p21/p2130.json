{"code":"P2130","description":"Throttle/Pedal Position Sensor/Switch \"F\" Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The TPS (Throttle Position Sensor) is a potentiometer that is mounted to the throttle body. It detects the throttle blade angle. As the throttle blade moves, the TPS sends a signal to the PCM (Powertrain Control Module). Usually a three wire sensor: A 5 volt reference from the PCM to the TPS, a ground from the PCM to the TPS, and a signal return from the TPS to the PCM.","\nÂ ","The TPS sends the throttle position information back to the PCM on this signal wire. When the throttle is closed the signal is near .45 volts. At WOT (Wide Open Throttle) the TPS signal voltage will approach a full 5 volts. When the PCM sees a voltage that is outside of normal operating range, P2130 will set. The \"F\" refers to a particular circuit, sensor, or area of a particular circuit.","NOTE: The PCM knows that any large change in throttle position means a cooresponding change in manifold pressure (MAP). On some models the PCM will monitor MAP and TPS operation for comparison. Meaning that if the PCM sees a large percentage change in throttle position, it expects to see a cooresponding change in manifold pressure and vice versa. If it doesn't see this comparitive change, P2130 may set. This doesn't apply to all models."],"symptoms":["Potential symptoms include:","MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nMisfiring at idle or at highway speed\nPoor idle quality\nPossibly won't idle\nPossibly starts and stalls"],"causes":["Potential causes of the P2130 code include:","Sticking throttle return spring\nMAP or TPS connector corrosion\nMisrouted harness causing chafing\nBad TPS\nBad PCM"]}
