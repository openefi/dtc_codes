{"code":"P215B","description":"Vehicle Speed - Output Shaft Speed Correlation","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. Vehicle makes may include but aren't limited to Ford, Chevy / Chevrolet, etc.","\nÂ ","If your OBD-II equipped vehicle has stored a code P215B, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a discrepancy between the vehicle (output) speed sensor and the output shaft speed sensor.","The vehicle (output) speed sensor and the output shaft speed sensor are both intended to detect vehicle. In the type of system intended to exhibit a code P215B, the vehicle (output) speed sensor is located in the differential and the output shaft speed sensor is situated near the output shaft housing of the transmission (2WD) or transfer case (4WD).","The vehicle (output) speed sensor and the output shaft speed sensor are both electromagnetic sensors which are mounted in close proximity to some type of toothed reluctor ring wheel or gear. The reluctor ring is mechanically affixed to an axle, transmission/transfer case output shaft, ring gear, or driveshaft. The reluctor ring spins in conjunction with the axle. As the reluctor ring teeth pass within thousandths-of-an-inch of the output shaft speed sensor, the magnetic field completes the sensor input circuit. The notches between the reluctor ring teeth create interruptions in the same circuit. These completions/interruptions occur in rapid succession as the vehicle rolls forward. These circuit completions and interruptions create wave form patterns that are received by the PCM (and other controllers) as vehicle speed or output shaft speed. As wave form pattern speed increases, estimated vehicle and output shaft speed increases. Likewise, as the input speed of the wave form slows, estimated vehicle or output shaft speed decreases.","The PCM is constantly monitoring vehicle (output) speed and output shaft speed when the vehicle is moving forward. If the PCM detects a variation between the vehicle (output) speed sensor and the output shaft speed sensor that exceeds the maximum threshold (for a set amount of time) a code P215B will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A transmission speed sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Erratic speedometer\nInadvertent ABS or traction control system (TCS) activation\nIrregular transmission shift patterns\nABS codes may be stored\nThe ABS may be disabled"],"causes":["Incorrect final drive gear ratio (differential ring gear and pinion)\nExcessive metallic debris on vehicle (output)/output shaft speed sensor magnet\nDefective vehicle (output)/output shaft speed sensor\nTransmission slippage\nCut or damaged wiring or connectors\nBroken, damaged, or worn reluctor ring teeth\nFaulty PCM or PCM programming error"]}
