{"code":"P219F","description":"Cylinder #4 Imbalance Error","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Toyota, Audi, Kia, VW, Lexus, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","When a code P219F is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an imbalance error in the number four cylinder. To monitor the air to fuel ratio for each cylinder of the engine, the PCM uses data input from heated exhaust oxygen sensors (sometimes called air fuel sensors) and the crankshaft position (CKP) and camshaft position (CMP) sensors.","Each oxygen sensor is constructed using a zirconium dioxide sensing element situated in the center of a vented steel housing. Tiny electrodes (usually of platinum) attach the sensing element to wire leads in the oxygen sensor harness connector and the connector plugs into the controller area network (CAN) which connects the oxygen sensor wiring harness to the PCM connector.","Each oxygen sensor is threaded (or studded) into an exhaust pipe. It is situated so the the sensing element is near the center of the pipe. As spent exhaust gases exit the combustion chamber (via the exhaust manifold) and continue through the exhaust system (including catalytic converters), they flow over the oxygen sensors. Exhaust gases enter the oxygen sensor through specially designed vent holes in the steel housing and swirl around the sensing element. Swirling ambient air is drawn through wire lead cavities in the sensor housing in order to fill a tiny chamber in the middle of the sensor. The air (in the tiny chamber) is then heated. This forces the oxygen ions to produce energy that is recognized by the PCM as voltage. Variations between the number of oxygen ions in ambient air (drawn into the O2 sensor), and the number of oxygen molecules in the exhaust, cause the oxygen ions inside the O2 sensor to bounce from one platinum layer to the other, very swiftly and repetitively. As the surging oxygen ions shift between platinum layers, variations in oxygen sensor output voltage occur. The PCM sees these variations in oxygen sensor output voltage as changes in exhaust oxygen concentration. Voltage signal outputs from the oxygen sensors are lower when more oxygen is present in the exhaust (lean condition) and higher when less oxygen is present in the exhaust (rich condition).","Crankshaft and camshaft position sensors are of the electromagnetic variety. They are triggered by a steel ring that rotates with the engine. A signal is sent to the PCM in the form of a waveform pattern. Inconsistencies in the waveform pattern are interpreted by the PCM as variations in engine RPM and/or cylinder efficiency.","If the PCM detects an imbalance in the air to fuel ratio for a engine cylinder four, a code P219F will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Most vehicles will require multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Diminished fuel efficiency\nA lack of general engine performance\nStored misfire codes or lean/rich exhaust codes\nService engine soon lamp illumination"],"causes":["Inadequate engine compression\nDefective oxygen sensor/s\nFaulty CKP or CMP sensor\nBurnt, chafed, broken, or disconnected wiring and/or connectors\nA faulty mass air flow or manifold air pressure sensor\nBad fuel pump or clogged fuel filter"]}
