{"code":"P0989","description":"Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor / Switch \"E\" Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBD-II equipped vehicles including but not limited to Chevrolet, Acura, Honda, Saturn, Jeep, Toyota, etc.","The Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch (TFPS) is usually found attached to the side of the valve body inside the transmission, although sometimes it may be found screwed into the side of the transmission case/body itself.","\n ","The TFPS converts the mechanical transmission pressures into an electrical signal for the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or Transmission Control Module (TCM). Typically, the PCM/TCM will then inform other controllers utilizing the vehicle's data communication bus.","The PCM/TCM receives this voltage signal to determine transmission operating pressure or when a shift is occurring. This code is set if this \"E\" input does not match normal operating voltages stored in the PCM/TCM's memory. It may also be due to internal mechanical issues inside the transmission. Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to determine which is the \"E\" circuit for your particular vehicle.","P0989 is typically an electrical circuit (TFPS sensor circuit) issue. This cannot be overlooked in the troubleshooting stage, especially when dealing with an intermittent problem.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of TFPS sensor and wire colors.","Related trans fluid pressure sensor \"E\" circuit codes:","P0987 Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch \"E\" Circuit\nP0988 Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch \"E\" Circuit Range/Performance\nP0990 Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch \"E\" Circuit High\nP0991 Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch \"E\" Circuit Intermittent"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nChange in shift quality\nVehicle starts off in 2nd or 3rd gear (limp in mode)"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Short to ground in the signal circuit to the TFPS sensor - possible\nFailed TFPS Sensor / internally shorted – likely\nFailed PCM - unlikely (programming required after replacement)"]}
