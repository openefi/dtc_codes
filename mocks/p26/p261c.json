{"code":"P261C","description":"Coolant Pump \"B\" Control Circuit Low","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBDII equipped engines with electric coolant pumps, but shows up more often in certain hybrids vehicles by Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota.","The Coolant Pump B (CP-B) is can usually be found mounted to the front of the engine, on top of the engine, inside the wheel wells or against the bulkhead. The CP-B is operated by an electrical signal from the Powertrain Control Module (PCM).","\nÂ ","The PCM receives inputs to determine when and how long it needs to operate the CP-B. These inputs are voltage signals received from coolant temp, intake air temp, engine rpm and air conditioning system pressure sensors. Once the PCM has received these inputs it can modify the signal to the CP-B.","P261C is typically set because of electrical (CP-B circuit) issues. These cannot be overlooked in the troubleshooting stage, especially when dealing with an intermittent problem.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of CP-B and wire colors.","Related coolant pump \"B\" circuit trouble codes:","P261A Coolant Pump \"B\" Control Circuit/Open\nP261B Coolant Pump \"B\" Control Circuit Range/Performance\nP261D Coolant Pump \"B\" Control Circuit High\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nOverheating\nA/C system not functioning properly"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Open in the circuit to the Coolant Pump - likely\nFailed Coolant Pump - likely\nFailed PCM - unlikely"]}
