{"code":"P2610","description":"ECM/PCM Internal Engine Off Timer Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, Subaru, Hyundai, Dodge, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","When I encounter a stored code P2610, it tells me that a malfunction has occurred, in the engine control module (ECM) or powertrain control module (PCM), concerning an inability to determine whether or not the engine has been shut off; and more specifically for how long the engine has been shut off.","\nÂ ","The engine controller, whether it is referred to as an ECM or a PCM, uses input signals from the engine to determine whether or not the engine is running. Among the engine control indicators used to accomplish this are engine RPM (crankshaft position sensor), fuel pressure sensor, and primary ignition system voltage. If the ECM/PCM fails to detect a signal from one of these (or any one of a number of other) indicators signifying that the engine has been shut off, when switched (present only when the ignition switch is placed in the on position) voltage is not detected, it may not discern that the engine has been shut off.","The ECM/PCM internal engine off timer is critical to monitoring ignition cycles which help to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing, as well as transmission shift patterns. If the ECM/PCM fails to declare the engine shut off and begin monitoring time between ignition cycles, a code P2610 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated. Typically, multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) will be required for malfunction indicator lamp illumination.\n"],"symptoms":["Initially, no obvious symptoms will likely appear\nDiminished engine performance\nDecreased fuel efficiency\nEventually, engine drivability symptoms may also be exhibited"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","ECM/PCM programming errors\nDefective ECM/PCM\nOpen or shorted wiring or connectors\nFaulty crankshaft position sensor (CPS) or shorted CPS wiring"]}
