{"code":"P0454","description":"Evaporative Emission Control System Pressure Sensor Intermittent","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Dodge, Ram, Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, VW, Audi, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","When your OBD-II equipped vehicle exhibits a code P0454, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an intermittent signal from the evaporative emissions (EVAP) system pressure sensor circuit.","\nÂ ","In an effort to capture fuel vapors before they escape into the atmosphere, the EVAP system utilizes a vented reservoir (usually called a canister) to store excessive fuel vapors until the engine is being operated under the appropriate conditions to burn them effectively.","Fuel storage tank vapors are discharged through the pressure relief valve (in the top of the fuel tank). The pressure created when fuel is stored acts as propellant and causes the vapors to vent through a network of metal tubes and rubber hoses; eventually reaching the charcoal storage canister. The canister not only absorbs fuel vapors but also holds them for release at the appropriate time.","The typical EVAP system consists of a charcoal canister, the EVAP pressure sensor, the purge valve/solenoid, the vent control valve/solenoid, and a complex system of metal tubes and rubber hoses that stretches from the fuel tank to the engine compartment.","The purge control valve/solenoid, which is the hub of the EVAP system, is electronically controlled by the PCM. The purge control valve/solenoid is used to regulate intake vacuum to the EVAP canister so that fuel vapors are drawn into the engine when conditions are ideal for them to be burned as fuel instead of polluting the atmosphere.","EVAP pressure is monitored by the PCM using the EVAP pressure sensor. The EVAP pressure sensor can be difficult to access because it is usually located in the top of the fuel tank and integrated into the fuel pump/fuel level sending unit housing. If the PCM detects that the EVAP system pressure signal is intermittent, a code P0454 will be stored and the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","Related evaporative emission trouble codes include P0450, P0451, P0452, P0453, P0455, P0456, P0457, P0458, and P0459.\n"],"symptoms":["In most cases, there will be no symptoms exhibited with a code P0454\nA slight decrease in fuel efficiency\nMIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Defective EVAP pressure sensor\nClogged fuel tank pressure relief valve\nOpen or shorted EVAP pressure sensor wiring or connectors\nCracked or broken charcoal canister"],"type":"ERR"}
