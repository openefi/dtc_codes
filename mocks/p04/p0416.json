{"code":"P0416","description":"Secondary Air Injection System Switching Valve B Circuit Open","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Dodge, Ram, Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, VW, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","When I have been faced with diagnosing a code P0416, it has meant that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in a secondary air injection (SAI) system switching valve circuit. This particular switching valve has been given the designation B. Typically B refers to a particular switching valve in a system that uses multiple switching valves.","\nÂ ","In diagnostic terms, the word open could be substituted for disconnected, broken, or cut. Consult a reliable vehicle information source to determine the configuration of the SAI switching valve circuits for the vehicle in question and the exact location of switching valve B. As a method of reducing harmful exhaust emissions, the SAI system pumps ambient air into the engine exhaust system. Most automotive SAI systems use a belt driven pump to draw-in ambient air, compress it slightly, and inject the pressurized air into the engine exhaust manifolds.","One-way valves, switching valves, anti-backfire valves, and bypass valves, controlled by the PCM, are utilized to regulate and distribute air pressure as well as to protect the SAI pump. The PCM receives voltage input signals from strategically placed pressure sensors to monitor fluctuations in SAI system pressure. When the required parameters are reached, the PCM electronically opens the necessary valves and allows secondary air to be pumped into the exhaust system.","Some vehicles are equipped with SAI systems designed with an electronic pump. In this type of system, the PCM monitors pressure sensors and activates the pump when required.","If the PCM detects a voltage input signal from the SAI switching valve (designated as B) that is too low or non-existent, a code P0416 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.","Other secondary air injection system trouble codes include P0410, P0411, P0412, P0413, P0414, P0415, P0417, P0418, P0419, P041F, P044F, P0491, and P0492.\n"],"symptoms":["There are likely to be no symptoms associated with this code\nA hissing or chugging noise from the SAI pipes or pump is possible\nLoud whining from SAI pump"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Burnt or broken wiring and/or connectors in the SAI system\nFrozen SAI pump (in geographic areas of extreme cold climate)\nDefective SAI pump\nFaulty SAI pump relay\nBad SAI pressure sensor"],"type":"WARN"}
