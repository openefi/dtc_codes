{"code":"P0419","description":"Secondary Air Injection System Relay B Circuit Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Dodge, Ram, Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, VW, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","When I come across a stored code P0419, I know that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in a secondary air injection (SAI) system relay circuit. The B designation denotes a particular relay in a system that uses more than one.","\nÂ ","Modern automobiles use SAI systems as a method of reducing harmful exhaust emissions with the introduction of ambient air into the engine exhaust system. SAI designs include either a belt driven pump or an electric pump to draw-in ambient air, compress it slightly, and inject the pressurized air into the engine exhaust manifolds. The PCM electronically controls one-way valves, switching valves, anti-backfire valves, and bypass valves to regulate and distribute air pressure and protect the SAI pump.","Fluctuations in SAI system pressure are monitored by the PCM using voltage input signals from one or more pressure sensors. When SAI pressure falls below a certain degree, the PCM electronically opens the necessary valves and allows secondary air to be pumped into the exhaust system. Engine temperature, engine RPM, and vehicle speed are also considered in SAI pump activation.","In vehicles that are equipped with electric pumps, the PCM monitors SAI pressure sensors and activates the pump when required. The system relay serves to transfer battery voltage from the fuse panel or fusible link to the SAI pump.","If the PCM detects a voltage input signal from the SAI relay (designated as B) circuit that indicates a malfunction has occurred, a code P0419 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.","Other secondary air injection system trouble codes include P0410, P0411, P0412, P0413, P0414, P0415, P0416, P0417, P0418, P041F, P044F, P0491, and P0492.\n"],"symptoms":["Frequently, there are no symptoms exhibited with a stored code P0419\nNo SAI pump activation"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Defective SAI pump relay\nShorted wiring, components, and/or connectors in the SAI system\nDefective SAI pump\nBlown SAI system fuses"],"type":"ERR"}
