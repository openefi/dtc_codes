{"code":"P0410","description":"Secondary Air Injection System Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The P0410 code refers to the emissions system. The AIR pump puts air to the exhaust to lower emissions. It takes in outside air and pumps it through two one-way check valves into each bank of the exhaust.","\nÂ ","About 90% of the time that this code is set, the one-way check valves have worn out or failed and allow water (which occurs naturally in the exhaust) back into the pump. In any cold climate, especially in climates with higher humidity, this water may be more excessive. The water partially fills the AIR pump, it can then freeze. When the PCM commands the pump on, if the pump is frozen it cannot turn, thus overloading the circuit and \"popping\" the fuse.","Other secondary air injection system trouble codes include P0411, P0412, P0413, P0414, P0415, P0416, P0417, P0418, P0419, P041F, P044F, P0491, and P0492."],"symptoms":["Possibly symptoms include:","MIL illumination obviously\nHesitation on acceleration\nNoise from a bad/stuck AIR pump"],"causes":["A code P0410 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Water may have collected in the AIR pump or the vent solenoid and frozen or corroded the pump\nBlown AIR pump fuse due to freezing up"],"type":"ERR"}
