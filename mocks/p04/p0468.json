{"code":"P0468","description":"Purge Flow Sensor Circuit High","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code can typically apply to all OBDII equipped engines, but shows up more often in certain Mercedes Benz vehicles.","The Purge Flow Sensor (PFS) is usually found mounted in the evaporative fuel system, also known as the charcoal canister, close to the fuel tank or possibly even in the top of the fuel tank / fuel pump module. The PFS converts the EVAP system pressure into an electrical signal for the Powertrain Control Module (PCM).","\n ","The PCM receives this voltage signal to determine how much fuel it will put into the engine along with the fuel entering the intake manifold from the EVAP system. This code is set if this input does not match normal engine operating conditions stored in the PCM’s memory, even for a second, as this diagnostic trouble code demonstrates. It also looks at the voltage signal from the PFS sensor to determine if it is correct at initial Key On.","P0468 is set when the voltage at the sensor stays above a set level (usually over 4.8V) for too long a period of time. This code is usually considered to be an electrical circuit issue.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of PFS sensor and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nDecrease in fuel economy"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Short to power in the signal circuit to the PFS sensor - possible\nOpen in the ground circuit at PFS sensor - likely\nFailed PFS Sensor - possible\nFailed PCM - unlikely"],"type":"WARN"}
