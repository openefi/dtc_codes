{"code":"P0400","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Flow Malfunction","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve is vacuum controlled valve that regulates the amount of exhaust gases that re-enter the cylinders.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) determines how much based on engine load, temp, and other conditions. If the PCM detects that the amount of exhaust gases entering the cylinder were insufficient or non-existent, this code is set."],"symptoms":["No symptoms will likely be noticed by the driver other than the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp). However, non visible symptoms will be increased combustion temperature and increased Nox emissions."],"causes":["A code P0400 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Plugged EGR passage which restricts the flow of exhaust gasses\nFaulty EGR solenoid\nFaulty EGR solenoid wiring/harness\nVacuum lines damaged/disconnected to the EGR valve solenoid or to the EGR valve\nFaulty EGR valve"],"type":"ERR"}
