{"code":"P0403","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation \"A\" Control Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system is controlled by a vacuum solenoid. The solenoid is supplied ignition voltage. The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) controls the vacuum solenoid by grounding the control circuit(ground) or driver","\nÂ ","The primary function of the driver is to supply ground for the object that is being controlled. Each driver has a fault circuit that the PCM monitors. When the PCM turns a component on, the control circuit voltage is low, or close to zero. When the component is turned off, the voltage on the control circuit is high, or near battery voltage. The PCM watches for these conditions, and if it doesn\\'t see the proper voltage at the proper time, this code is set."],"symptoms":["Usually a fault in the control circuit, will leave no noticeable symptoms other than the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination. However, if the EGR control solenoid is stuck open due to debris, etc. the code may be accompanied by misfire under acceleration, rough idle, or engine dying altogether."],"causes":["The causes for a P0403 EGR code could be any of the following:","Bad EGR solenoid\nExcessive resistance in control circuit (PCM controlled ground) due to an open, chafing or damage to the harness\nPoor connection at the EGR solenoid harness (worn or loose pins)\nWater intrusion at the EGR solenoid harness\nBlockage in EGR control solenoid holding solenoid open or closed causing excessive resistance\nLoss of supply voltage to EGR solenoid\nBad PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
