{"code":"P0495","description":"Fan Speed High","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Chevrolet, Buick, Peugeot, Toyota, Citroen, Dodge, BMW Honda, Acura, Ford, Dodge, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The fan the manufacturers are referring to in these codes is the cooling fan. Generally speaking, the fan is mounted on the radiator. It's function is to cool down the coolant in the radiator and help regulate engine temperature.","\nÂ ","The engine control module (ECM) or power train control module (PCM) monitors/controls a multitude of sensors in order to monitor and regulate the temperature of the engine. The ECM switches the fan on when engine temperatures get high (e.g. idling in traffic), and off when airflow is sufficient to keep temperatures down (i.e. cruising down the highway).","While monitoring the cooling fan, the ECM detected a high speed condition. If the cooling fan is spinning beyond or below the manufacturers set parameters, the engine light or malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will be illuminated by the ECM.\n","Related engine cooling fan diagnostic codes:","P0493 Fan Overspeed\nP0494 Fan Speed Low"],"symptoms":["Engine overheating\nEngine noises\nPoor performance\nEngine misfiring\nStalling\nPoor fuel mileage"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Broken or damaged wiring harness\nMalfunctioning fan clutch\nCooling fan clutch or bearing defective\nCooling fan relay defective\nECM issue\nPin/connector problem (e.g. corrosion)"],"type":"WARN"}
