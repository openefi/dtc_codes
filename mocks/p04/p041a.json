{"code":"P041A","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation Temperature Sensor B Circuit","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) that typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Mazda, VW, Audi, Mercedes Benz, Ford, Dodge, Ram, etc.","Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","Before the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) systems were effectively introduced to vehicles in the 1970's, engines were actively wasting unburned fuel and expelling it to the atmosphere. These days on the other hand, a vehicle has to have a certain emission rating in order to proceed with production.","The use of EGR systems has greatly improved emissions by recirculating fresh exhaust coming from the exhaust manifold and/or other parts of the exhaust system and recycling or re-burning it to make sure we are efficiently burning the fuel that we pay for with our hard earned cash!","The function of the EGR temperature sensor is essentially to provide a means for the ECM (Engine Control Module) to monitor the temperature within the EGR system and/or adjust flow accordingly using the EGR valve. It does this easily using a common temperature sensitive resistor-type sensor.","Your OBD (On-Board Diagnostic) scan tool may show P041A and associated codes active when the ECM detects a fault within the EGR temperature sensor or it's circuits. As I mentioned earlier, the system involves the exhaust which is hot, not only that but you are dealing with one of the hottest areas of the vehicle so be aware of where your hands/fingers are even with the engine off for a short period of time.","The code P041A Exhaust Gas Recirculation Temperature Sensor B Circuit is set by the ECM when there is a detected general malfunction in the EGR Temperature Sensor \"B\" circuit. Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to determine which is the \"B\" part of the circuit for your particular application."],"symptoms":["Failed smog or emissions state/provincial test\nEngine noise (knocking, rattling, pinging, etc.)\nLouder exhaust\nExcessive exhaust smells"],"causes":["Defective or damaged EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) temperature sensor\nEGR temperature sensor gasket leaking\nCracked or leaking exhaust pipe in which the sensor is mounted\nBurnt wiring harness and/or sensor\nDamaged wire(s) (open, short to power, short to ground, etc.)\nDamaged connector\nECM (Engine Control Module) issue\nPoor connections"],"type":"ERR"}
