{"code":"P0401","description":"Insufficient Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Flow","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","EGR stands for Exhaust Gas Recirculation. It is part of the vehicle emmissions system, and is used to reduce combustion temperature and pressure to control Oxides of Nitrogen. There are generally three parts to the EGR system: the EGR valve, an actuator solenoid, and a differential pressure sensor EGR (DPFE). These things work together to deliver the correct amount of recirculation based on engine temperature, load, etc. The P0401 code means that OBD detected an insufficient amount of EGR.","\nÂ "],"symptoms":["You may notice drivability problems such as pinging (a.k.a. pre-ignition knock) when the engine is under load or the vehicle is at higher speeds. There may also be other symptoms."],"causes":["A code P0401 most likely means one or more of the following has happened:","The DPFE (differential pressure feedback EGR) sensor is faulty and needs to be replaced\nThere is a blockage in the EGR (tube), most likely carbon buildup\nThe EGR valve is faulty\nThe EGR valve may not be opening due to a lack of vaccuum"],"type":"ERR"}
