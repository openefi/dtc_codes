{"code":"P044C","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation Sensor C Circuit Low","info":["This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model.","There are different designs of EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) systems, but they all operate in a similar way. The EGR valve is a PCM (Powertrain Control Module) controlled valve that allows measured amounts of exhaust gasses to pass back into the cylinders to be burned with the air/fuel mixture. Since exhaust gas is an inert gas that displaces oxygen, injecting it back into the cylinder can lower combustion temperatures which helps to improve NOx (oxides of nitrogen) emissions.","\nÂ ","EGR isn't needed on cold startup or at idle. EGR is commanded on under certain conditions like startup or at idle. EGR is commanded on under certain conditions like partial throttle or deceleration depending on engine temperature and load, etc. Exhaust gasses are supplied to the EGR valve from an exhaust pipe or the EGR valve may be mounted directly in the exhaust manifold. When needed, the valve is commanded \"on\" allowing the gasses to pass into the cylinders. Some systems divert exhaust gasses directly into the cylinders while others simply inject it into the intake manifold where it is then pulled into the cylinders. while others simply inject it into the intake manifold where it is then pulled into the cylinders.","Some EGR systems are quite simple while others are a little more complicated. Electrically controlled EGR valves are directly controlled by the PCM. A wiring harness plugs into the valve itself and is commanded by the PCM as it sees the need. These can be 4 or 5 wire. Usually 1 or 2 grounds 12 volt ignition feed, a 5 volt reference circuit, and a feedback circuit. Other systems are vacuum controlled. These are quite simple. The PCM controls a vacuum solenoid which when activated, allows vacuum to travel to the EGR valve and open it. There should also be an electrical connector on this type of EGR valve for the feedback circuit. The EGR system feedback circuit allows the PCM to see if the EGR valve pintle is actually moving as it should.","If the EGR \"C\" feedback circuit detects that the voltage is unusually low, or it's position is lower than it's commanded to be, P044C may set. Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual for the location of your \"C\" sensor.","Related EGR sensor \"C\" trouble codes:","P044A Exhaust Gas Recirculation Sensor \"C\" Circuit\nP044B Exhaust Gas Recirculation Sensor \"C\" Circuit Range/Performance\nP044D Exhaust Gas Recirculation Sensor \"C\" Circuit High\nP044E Exhaust Gas Recirculation Sensor \"C\" Circuit Intermittent/Erratic"],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P044C code include:","Short to ground in EGR signal or Reference circuits\nShort to voltage in EGR ground or signal circuits\nBad EGR valve\nBad PCM wiring issues due to chafing or loose terminals"],"type":"WARN"}
