{"code":"P040F","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation Temperature Sensor A/B Correlation","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles (Ford, Seat, Chevy, GMC, Ford, Dodge, Sprinter, VW, Subaru, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","If your OBD-II equipped vehicle has presented a stored code P040F, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a discrepancy between the primary and secondary (A and B) exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) temperature sensors. A stored code P040F may be the result of a mechanical issue or an electrical malfunction.","\nÂ ","The EGR system is designed to deliver a portion of spent exhaust gases back to the intake manifold so that it can be burned a second time. This process is required to reduce nitrous oxide (NOx) particles that are released into the atmosphere. NOx is a contributing component of ozone depleting exhaust emissions and NOx emissions are regulated by federal mandate.","EGR temperature sensors are (to my knowledge) relegated to diesel engine equipped vehicles. In most cases, engine coolant is used to reduce the temperature of engine exhaust gases before they are drawn into the EGR valve. A and B EGR temperature sensors provide the PCM with variations in exhaust gas temperature near the EGR valve. The PCM compares input signals from the two EGR temperature sensors and an exhaust temperature sensor to determine if the EGR cooling system is operating efficiently.","The EGR temperature sensors are located near the EGR valve and the exhaust temperature sensor is usually positioned in the down pipe. If the EGR temperature sensor input voltage signals are not within programmed specifications, or if the input signals from the EGR temperature sensor/s are not significantly lower than that of the exhaust temperature sensor, a P040F will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.","Other EGR temperature sensor trouble codes include P040A, P040B, P040C, P040D, P041A, P041B, P041C, P041D, P041E, and P041F."],"symptoms":["There may be no symptoms when this code is stored\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nCoolant leak\nExhaust leak\nExhaust temperature sensor codes"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Low engine coolant\nDefective EGR temperature sensor/s\nFaulty exhaust temperature sensor\nExhaust leaks\nClogged EGR cooler\nEngine overheating"],"type":"ERR"}
