{"code":"P0448","description":"Evaporative Emission Control System Vent Valve/Solenoid Circuit Shorted","info":["This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may vary depending on the model.","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) has detected that the circuit is shorted together that controls the vent valve or solenoid for evaporative emission systems vapor. In this case the code will also be thrown when the valve is stuck closed.","\nÂ ","As fuel sits in the tank it lets out fuel vapor, while driving this vent opens and allows the vapors to be circulated into the engine intake manifold, a charcoal canister or into the atmosphere, depending on the vehicle. This vent valve is apart of the simple, yet complicated evaporative emissions system."],"symptoms":[],"causes":["Potential causes may include:","Faulty vent valve\nWire/circuit issue\nPCM fault"],"type":"ERR"}
