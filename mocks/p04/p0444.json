{"code":"P0444","description":"Evaporative Emission Control System Purge Control Valve Circuit Open","info":["On vehicles equipped with Evaporative emission control systems also known as EVAP, the engine draws in excessive fuel vapors from the gas tank that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere.","\nÂ ","The fuel vapor is routed through a vacuum line to the engine's intake and the purge valve/solenoid meters the desired amount of fuel vapors, controlled by the vehicles powertrain control module (PCM) or engine control module (ECM). The PCM/ECM monitors the voltage to the purge control valve and has detected no voltage change with the purge valve commanded on.","Note: This code is similar to codes P0443 and P0445."],"symptoms":["Check engine light on (Malfunction indicator lamp illuminated)\nSlightly diminished fuel economy, this will not affect engine performance"],"causes":["Wiring harness loose or disconnected\nEngine wiring harness open circuit\nPurge control solenoid open circuit\nPCM/ECM malfunction"],"type":"WARN"}
