{"code":"P0445","description":"Evaporative Emission Control System Purge Control Valve Circuit Shorted","info":["On vehicles equipped with Evaporative emission control systems also known as EVAP, the engine draws in excessive fuel vapors from the gas tank that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere.","\nÂ ","The fuel vapor is routed through a vacuum line to the engine's intake and the purge valve/solenoid meters the desired amount of fuel vapors, controlled by the vehicles powertrain control module (PCM) or engine control module (ECM). The PCM/ECM monitors the voltage to the purge control valve and has detected a lower voltage than expected.","Note: This code is similar to codes P0443 and P0444."],"symptoms":["Check engine light on (Malfunction indicator lamp illuminated)\nSlightly diminished fuel economy, this will not affect engine performance"],"causes":["Engine wiring harness or connector short circuit\nPurge control solenoid short circuit\nPCM/ECM malfunction"],"type":"ERR"}
