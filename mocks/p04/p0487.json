{"code":"P0487","description":"Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Throttle Control Circuit \"A\" Open","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to diesel engines built after 2004, including but not limited to certain Ford, Dodge, GM, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and VW vehicles.","\n ","This valve is placed in between the intake manifold and the air filter, similar to a throttle body. It is used to create a small vacuum that will draw exhaust gases into the intake manifold.","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) tells the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) throttle control valve where to position itself. This code is looking at the voltage signals from the EGR throttle control valve to determine if they are correct based on inputs to the PCM. This code is letting you know that there is an electrical circuit fault.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of EGR throttle control valve and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nLonger than normal active aftertreatment regeneration times (it will take longer for the exhaust system to get hot and burn off the soot that has built up inside the diesel particulate filter/catalytic converter)"],"causes":["Typically the causes for this code to set are:","Open in the signal circuit between the EGR throttle control valve and the PCM\nShort to voltage in the signal circuit to the EGR throttle control valve\nShort to ground in the signal circuit to the EGR throttle control valve\nEGR throttle control valve faulty – internally shorted\nFailed PCM - unlikely"],"type":"WARN"}
