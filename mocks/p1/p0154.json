{"code":"P0154","description":"O2 Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected (Bank 2 Sensor 1)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The oxygen sensors are critical to the engine running properly. It basically informs the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) of oxygen content of the exhaust. The PCM then uses this information to regulate fuel into the engine and maintain proper air:fuel ratio. It is a four wire sensor, with the PCM providing a reference/signal voltage of about half a volt (0.5v) to the sensor. It usually provides a ground also","\nÂ ","The other two wires are dedicated to the oxygen sensor heater element. This heater allows the sensor to warm up faster, which allows the engine to enter closed loop faster, reducing startup emissions. The heater element is supplied a 12v feed from the power distribution center (usually) and a ground.","The oxygen content of the exhaust affects the O2 sensor resistance. This resistance produces a counter voltage on the reference/signal wire that the PCM will use to analyze oxygen in the exhaust. Lean exhaust produces low voltage, while rich exhaust produces high voltage. The oxygen sensor is capable of varying between 0.9v (rich) and 0.1v (lean). Once the engine reaches closed loop, the O2 sensor should begin switching rapidly between rich and lean voltages 2-3 times per second. If for some reason the O2 sensor doesn't switch properly or \"sticks\", P0154 may set. This code indicates the O2 sensor isn't operating."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nOther codes indicating rich or lean condition may be present\nPoor idle, won't idle\nMisfire at idle or at highway speed\nEngine may blow black smoke at tailpipe\nFuel economy may decrease\nMay start and stall"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0154 code include:","Faulty bank 2,1 Oxygen sensor\nHoles in exhaust near oxygen sensor\nShort to voltage or ground on signal circuit\nOpen or high resistance in signal circuit\nWiring harness chafing/rubbing on exhaust components\nWater/oil intrusion at O2 sensor connector\nBroken lock or loose terminals on O2 sensor connector\nOil/coolant fouled oxygen sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
