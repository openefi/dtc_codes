{"code":"P0123","description":"Throttle Position Sensor/Switch A Circuit High Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The TPS (Throttle Position Sensor) is a potentiometer that is mounted to the throttle body. It detects the throttle blade angle. As the throttle blade moves, the TPS sends a signal to the PCM (Powertrain Control Module), which is the main computer that runs the vehicle. Usually a three wire sensor: A 5 volt reference from the PCM to the TPS, a ground from the PCM to the TPS, and a signal return from the TPS to the PCM.","\nÂ ","The TPS sends the throttle position information back to the PCM on this signal wire. When the throttle is closed the signal is near .45 volts. At WOT (Wide Open Throttle) the TPS signal voltage will approach a full 5 volts. When the PCM sees a voltage that is higher than the normal upper limit, P0123 will set."],"symptoms":["Rough idle\nHigh idle\nSurging\nother symptoms may also be present"],"causes":["A code P0123 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","TPS not mounted securely\nTPS circuit short to ground or another wire\nFaulty TPS\nDamaged computer (PCM)"],"type":"WARN"}
