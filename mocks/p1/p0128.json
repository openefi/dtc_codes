{"code":"P0128","description":"Coolant Thermostat (Coolant Temperature Below Thermostat Regulating Temperature)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Brands of vehicles that may see this code include but are not limited to Pontiac, Toyota, Mazda, Dodge, Chevrolet, Honda, Jeep, Ford, VW, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","This means that the engine's powertrain control module (PCM) has detected that the engine has not reached the required temperature level within a specified amount of time after starting the engine. Often, the intent of the P0128 code is to indicate a faulty thermostat (likely stuck in the open condition). Similar codes: P0125","In determining that the engine did not reach a \"normal\" temperature, it takes into account the length of time the vehicle has been running, the intake air temperature (IAT) sensor reading, the engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor reading, and the speed of the vehicle."],"symptoms":["You will likely not notice any drivability problems other than the MIL illumination. In some cases you may experience symptoms such as:","Engine takes longer to warm up\nEngine temperature drops while driving at higher speeds","A photo of a typical thermostat:\n"],"causes":["A code P0128 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Low engine coolant level\nLeaking or stuck open thermostat (likely)\nFaulty cooling fan (running too much)\nFaulty coolant temperature (ECT) sensor\nFaulty intake air temperature (IAT) sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
