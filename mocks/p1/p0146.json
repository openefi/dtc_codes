{"code":"P0146","description":"02 Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected (Bank 1 Sensor 3)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The catalytic converter is used to control emissions. The o2 sensor on Bank 1, position 3 is aft of the converter and monitors the catalyst efficiency. The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) does this by comparing the post-cat o2 sensor to the pre-cat o2 sensors.","\nÂ ","The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a reference to the sensor of about half a volt and also supplies a sensor ground and 12 volts for the heater element. The fourth wire is a ground for the heater element (the heater in the sensor helps the sensor to warm up faster which allows the engine to reach closed loop sooner).","The sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content of the exhaust. Oxygen sensors are capable of varying between 0.1 volts to 0.9 volts. Lean exhaust produces low voltage and causes the supplied 0.45 volts to drop. Rich exhaust produces high voltage and causes the supplied 0.45 voltage to increase. Pre-catalyst o2 sensors switch between low and high voltage rapidly. However a post-cat o2 sensor may switch much slower & not vary as much (this is normal). If the sensor doesn't respond as it should or there are too few switches in a given time period, P0146 may set."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nMay idle or drive poorly\nFuel economy may decrease"],"causes":["Potential causes of an P0146 code include:","Bad Bank 1, position 3, o2 sensor\nWiring problem, melted harness, broken connectors, etc.\nBad PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
