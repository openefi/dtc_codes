{"code":"P018A","description":"Fuel Pressure Sensor B Circuit","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a fuel pressure sensor (Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Most modern vehicles are equipped with a fuel pressure sensor (FPS). The FPS is one of the main inputs to the powertrain control module (PCM) for fuel pump and/or fuel injector control.","\n ","The fuel pressure sensor is a type of sensor called a transducer. This type of sensor varies its internal resistance in relation to pressure. The FPS is typically mounted to either the fuel rail or fuel line. Generally, there are three wires going to the FPS: reference, signal and ground. The sensor receives a reference voltage from the PCM (typically 5-volts) and sends back a return signal voltage that corresponds to fuel pressure.","In the case of this code, the \"B\" indicates the problem is with a portion of the system circuit, instead of a particular symptom or component.","Code P018A is set when the PCM detects a malfunction in the fuel pressure sensor circuit. Related codes include P018B, P018C, P018D, and P018E.","An example of a fuel pressure sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Illuminated check engine light\nAn engine that is hard to start or does not start\nPoor engine performance"],"causes":["Possible causes for this code may include:","Faulty fuel pressure sensor\nFuel delivery problems\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
