{"code":"P0147","description":"O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1 Sensor 3)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","O2 (Oxygen) sensors contain a heating element that allows the sensor to reach operating temperature quickly. This lowers emissions since it allows the engine to reach closed loop faster and also allows the engine to stay in closed loop at idle.","\nÂ ","The heater circuit is supplied a 12 V battery feed from the PCM or ignition circuit (depending on model) and a ground. The PCM (powertrain control module) monitors how long it takes for the sensors to become active after engine start-up. If it takes too long for the o2 sensors to reach operating temperature, this P0147 can set."],"symptoms":["For this particular o2 sensor, there may be no noticeable symptoms other than:","MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nPoor/ rough idle"],"causes":["Potential causes of an P0147 code include:","Bad o2 sensor heater circuit\nBad o2 sensor\nWiring harness problems"],"type":"ERR"}
