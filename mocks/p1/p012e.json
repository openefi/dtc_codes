{"code":"P012E","description":"Turbocharger/Supercharger Inlet Pressure Sensor Circuit Intermittent/Erratic (Downstream of throttle valve)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a turbocharger or supercharger inlet pressure sensor. Brand of vehicles may include but are not limited to Ford, Dodge, Saturn, Nissan, Subaru, Honda, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model/engine.","A P012E code indicates some sort of intermittent or erratic malfunction within the Turbo/Supercharger Inlet Pressure Sensor (TCIP) circuit. The turbo/supercharger are responsible for increasing \"volumetric efficiency\" (amount of air) within the combustion chamber by creating pressure within the intake system.","\nÂ ","Generally speaking Turbochargers are exhaust driven and Superchargers are belt driven. The inlet of the turbo/supercharger is where they get their filtered air from the air filter. The inlet sensor works with the ECM (Electronic Control Module) or PCM (Powertrain Control Module) in order to monitor and regulate intake pressure.","The \"(Downstream of throttle valve)\" indicates what specific inlet sensor has the malfunction and it's location. The pressure sensor may also incorporate a temperature sensor into it.\n","This trouble code is closely related to P012A, P012B, P012C, and P012D."],"symptoms":["Vehicle enters limp mode (Fail safe mode)\nEngine noises\nPoor performance\nEngine misfiring\nStalling\nPoor fuel mileage"],"causes":["Defective Turbo/supercharger inlet pressure sensor\nBroken or damaged wiring harness\nProblem within general electrical system\nECM issue\nPin/connector problem.
