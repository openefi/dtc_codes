{"code":"P010F","description":"Mass or Volume Air Flow Sensor A/B Correlation","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have multiple air intakes or multiple throttle bodies. Makes of vehicles may include but are not limited to Lexus, Peugeot, Citroen, VW, Toyota, Audi, Dodge, Ram, Mercedes Benz, GMC, Chevrolet, etc.","When you encounter a stored code P010F, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction with the mass air flow (MAF) or volume air flow (VAF) system.","\nÂ ","The use of code P010F is limited to vehicles which are equipped with multiple throttle bodies or intake air inlet sources that require multiple MAF/VAF sensors. A P010F relates to a comparison between the separate MAF/VAF sensors.","A strong vacuum is created when the internal combustion engine is in operation. This vacuum draws in needed air to complete the combustion process. This air is regulated by the throttle plate (controlled by the driver) under acceleration and the idle air control (IAC) valve when the engine is at idle.","One of the most critical factors in the optimization of fuel efficiency and minimization of harmful exhaust emissions in mass produced automobiles is achieving a correct fuel to air ratio. The air entering the intake is measured, as you have probably guessed, using the MAF or VAF sensor/s. Fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy is calculated (by the PCM) using data contrived from the MAF/VAF sensor/s. The air which passes through these devices is referred to as metered air. Air which is involuntarily introduced to the engine can contribute to excessively lean (too much air or not enough fuel) conditions and is called unmetered air.","Here is an example of a MAF sensor:\n","Here is a brief explanation of the two types of air metering devices","The MAF sensor is used most commonly in domestic vehicles. It focuses on a thermal resistor that is suspended in the bore of the sensor so that air can flow directly across it. Hot wire type MAF sensors use voltage applied directly to a single resistor to monitor intake air. As air flow increases, the temperature of the resistor decreases and the resistance level drops. These changes in resistance level result in variations of circuit voltage which the PCM receives as the degree of metered air that is being introduced to the engine intake for precise distribution to individual combustion chambers.","Cold wire MAF sensors use a similar system of metering intake air but utilize a pair of thermal resistors. One is positioned in a recessed area of the sensor housing and measures ambient air temperature only. The second is positioned near the center of the bore where incoming air can flow across it, in varied degrees. The PCM compares the thermal voltage values of each of these resistors to determine how much metered air is being drawn into the intake.","The VAF is designed with a door or flap that is opened according to how much air is drawn into the intake. It is used primarily in imported vehicles. As intake air decreases, the spring loaded flap is closed. The action of the door/flap actuates a potentiometer that transmits a data signal to the PCM. The PCM recognizes variations in potentiometer voltage as the degree of metered air being drawn into the engine and calculates engine drivability strategy accordingly.","When multiple MAF/VAF sensors are used in conjunction with each other, the PCM compares data between the two in order to ensure that a similar conclusion is derived. If the degree of air flow or sensor voltage varies by more than a preprogrammed amount, a code P010F will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated."],"symptoms":["Diminished engine performance\nDecreased fuel efficiency\nEngine stall or hesitation upon acceleration\nLean or rich exhaust codes\nNo start condition"],"causes":["Possible causes for this code may include:","Defective MAF/VAF sensor\nOpen or shorted circuits in the MAF/VAF system\nEngine vacuum leaks (unmetered air)\nSplit, cracked, or broken air inlet pipe"],"type":"ERR"}
