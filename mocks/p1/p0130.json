{"code":"P0130","description":"O2 Sensor Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1 Sensor 1)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The O2 sensor produces a voltage based on oxygen content in the exhaust. The voltage varies between .1 and .9 Volts, .1 indicating lean and .9 indicating rich.","\nÂ ","The ECM constantly monitors this voltage while in closed loop to determine how much fuel to inject. If the ECM determines that the O2 sensor voltage was too low (less than .4 Volts) for too long (for more than 20 seconds (time varies with model)), this code is set."],"symptoms":["Depending if the problem is intermittent or not, there may be no symptoms other than MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. If the problem is constant, then symptoms may include one or more of the following:","MIL illumination\nEngine runs rough, missing or stumbling\nBlows black smoke from tail pipe\nEngine dies\nPoor fuel economy"],"causes":["Usually the cause of P0130 is a bad oxygen sensor, however this isn't always the case. If your o2 sensors haven't been replaced and they are old, it's a good bet that the sensor is the problem. But, It could be caused by any of the following:","Water or corrosion in the connector\nLoose terminals in the connector\nWiring burnt on exhaust components\nOpen or short in the wiring due to rubbing on engine components\nHoles in exhaust allowing unmetered oxygen into exhaust system\nUnmetered vacuum leak at the engine\nBad o2 sensor\nBad PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
