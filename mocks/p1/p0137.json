{"code":"P0137","description":"Oxygen O2 Sensor Circuit Low Voltage (Bank 1, Sensor 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Essentially the same as P0136, P0137 refers to the second oxygen sensor on Bank 1. P0137 means the O2 oxygen sensor's voltage remained low for longer than 2 minutes.","\nÂ ","This, is interpreted by the ECM as a low voltage condition and sets the MIL. Bank 1 Sensor 2 is located to the rear of the catalytic converter and should produce an output signal relative to oxygen storage capacity of the catalytic converter. This rear (sensor 2) sensor is less active than the signal produced by the front sensor. However, if the ECM senses the sensor is inactive, this code will set."],"symptoms":["There may be no visible symptoms to the driver, other than the MIL (Check Engine / Service Engine Soon) illumination."],"causes":["A code P0137 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Faulty o2 sensor Exhaust leak near the rear sensor\nPlugged catalyst\nShort to voltage on O2 signal circuit\nHigh resistance or open on O2 signal circuit\nEngine running very rich or lean\nEngine misfire condition\nFuel pressure very high or low - fuel pump or pressure regulator"],"type":"WARN"}
