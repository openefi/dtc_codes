{"code":"P0176","description":"Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit Malfunction","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II equipped vehicles including but not limited to Ford, BMW, Chevy, Pontiac, Mazda, VW, Honda, Scion, Land Rover, etc.","There are four trouble codes commonly associated with fuel composition sensor circuit malfunctions. This circuit is also referred to as the as the flex fuel sensor circuit and the OBDII codes that are triggered by the Engine Control Module (ECM) when this circuit malfunctions are P0176, P0177, P0178 and P0179.","\nÂ ","The fuel composition sensor circuit monitors the amount of ethanol in the gasoline on a flex fuel engine. The amount of ethanol can very every time you fill up the tank requiring appropriate adjustments for optimal performance and fuel economy. The fuel composition sensor circuit sends a signal to the ECM based on the ethanol level. The ECM adjusts the ignition timing and fuel injector pulse width accordingly to burn the fuel more efficiently. The end result is improved performance, reduced pollution and increased fuel economy.","Code P0176 is set when the ECM detects any malfunction within the fuel composition sensor circuit.","Trouble code P0176 is triggered by the ECM when it receives a signal that is abnormal or out of range. This code identifies various malfunctions within the circuit and the issue may be physical, mechanical or electrical. In most circumstances the presence of a P0178 or P0179 is a very good indication that the problem is electrical in nature."],"symptoms":["Increased fuel consumption\nPoor performance\nCheck Engine Light illuminated\nEngine stalls"],"causes":["Typically, potential causes for this code include:","Faulty Fuel Cap\nContaminated fuel\nFaulty Fuel Composition Sensor\nCorroded or damaged connector\nDamaged or restricted fuel line\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty ECM"],"type":"ERR"}
