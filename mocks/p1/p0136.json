{"code":"P0136","description":"Oxygen O2 Sensor Circuit Low Voltage (Bank 1, Sensor 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Essentially the same as P0137, a P0136 code refers to the second oxygen sensor on Bank 1. The O2 oxygen sensor produces a voltage between 0.1 V and 0.9 V. The ECM monitors O2 sensor voltage and determines if exhaust is lean or rich.","\nÂ ","O2 sensor voltage is high when exhaust is rich and low when exhaust is lean. The ECM monitors this voltage and increases or decreases fuel injector pulsewidth according to engine fuel/air ratio. If the ECM detects low HO2Sensor voltage for an extended period, it will set P0136 Conditions required to set: HO2 sensor voltage is low for longer than 2 minutes (minutes depend on model of vehicle. Could be up to 4 minutes)"],"symptoms":["There may be no visible symptoms to the driver. Poor fuel mileage, possible misfire, depending on O2 sensor position when sticking."],"causes":["A code P0136 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Faulty O2 sensor leak in exhaust close to O2 sensor\nShort to voltage on O2 signal circuit\nOpen in circuit resistance caused by corrosion in connector"],"type":"WARN"}
