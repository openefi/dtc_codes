{"code":"P018B","description":"Fuel Pressure Sensor B Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a fuel pressure sensor (Chevrolet, Ford, GMC, Chrysler, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model. Anecdotally this code seems a lot more common on GM vehicles (GMC, Chevrolet, etc.) and may be accompanied with a P018C code and/or other codes at the same time.","Most modern vehicles are equipped with a fuel pressure sensor (FPS). The FPS is one of the main inputs to the powertrain control module (PCM) for fuel pump and/or fuel injector control.","\nÂ ","The fuel pressure sensor is a type of sensor called a transducer. This type of sensor varies its internal resistance in relation to pressure. The FPS is typically mounted to either the fuel rail or fuel line. Generally, there are three wires going to the FPS: reference, signal and ground. The sensor receives a reference voltage from the PCM (typically 5-volts) and sends back a return signal voltage that corresponds to fuel pressure.","In the case of this code, the \"B\" indicates the problem is with a portion of the system circuit, instead of a particular symptom or component.","Code P018B is set when the PCM detects a performance problem with the fuel pressure sensor. Related codes include P018A, P018C, P018D, and P018E.","An example of a fuel pressure sensor:\n"],"symptoms":["Illuminated check engine light\nAn engine that is hard to start or does not start\nPoor engine performance"],"causes":["Possible causes for this code may include:","Faulty fuel pressure sensor\nFuel delivery problems\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
