{"code":"P0111","description":"Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor 1 Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The IAT (Intake Air Temperature) sensor is a thermistor that varies resistance based upon the temperature of the engine intake air. Usually a two wire sensor. One wire is supplied 5 Volt from the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) and the other is a ground. The PCM monitors the change in the 5 Volt supplied to determine air temperature. When the intake air is cold, the resistance is high, resulting in a high signal voltage.","\nÂ ","When the intake air is warm, the reistance is low, resulting in a low signal voltage. This code means that the PCM saw a larger-than-normal change in a shorter-than-expected time on the IAT signal circuit."],"symptoms":["Since this code is likely pointing to an intermittent problem on the IAT circuit, there may not be any symptoms at present. However, the MIL will likely be on. The car MAY exhibit some drivability problems, but it is more likely that there will be no noticeable symptoms to the driver."],"causes":["Potential causes of the P0111 DTC include:","a bad IAT sensor\nan open in the signal or ground circuit\na short to ground on the signal circuit\npoor connection at sensor or PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
