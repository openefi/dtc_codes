{"code":"P0138","description":"O2 Oxygen Sensor Circuit High Voltage (Bank1, Sensor2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The Heated Oxygen Sensor (2) located rear of catalytic converter produces an output signal relative to oxygen storage capacity of catalytic converter. Bank 1 is the side of the engine that contains the #1 cylinder.","\nÂ ","Ho2S 2 signal is less active than signal produced by front oxygen sensor. This code sets when HO2 Sensor voltage is greater than 999 mV for more than 2 minutes (time depends on model. Could be as high as 4 minutes)"],"symptoms":["There may be no noticeable symptoms except for MIL illumination. Possible high fuel pressure can over rich the system."],"causes":["A code P0138 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Faulty O2 sensor\nShort to battery voltage in O2 sensor signal circuit\nHigh fuel pressure (not as likely)"],"type":"WARN"}
