{"code":"P0108","description":"Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit High Input","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor measures engine manifold negative air pressure. It's usually a three wire sensor: a ground wire, a 5 volt reference wire from the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) to the MAP sensor, and a signal wire that informs the PCM of the MAP sensor voltage reading as it changes.","\nÂ ","The higher the engine vacuum, the lower the voltage reading. The voltage should range between about 1 volt (at idle) to about 5 volts (WOT wide open throttle).","If the PCM sees the voltage reading from the MAP sensor is greater than 5 Volts, or if the voltage reading is higher than what the PCM considers normal under certain circumstances, a P0108 DTC will set.","\nA typical MAP sensor"],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) will likely be on\nEngine may run poorly\nEngine may not run at all\nFuel mileage may decrease\nPresence of black smoke at exhaust"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0108 code:","Bad MAP sensor\nLeak in vacuum supply line to MAP sensor\nEngine vacuum leak\nShort on signal wire to PCM\nShort on reference voltage wire from PCM\nOpen in ground circuit to MAP\nWorn engine causing low vacuum"],"type":"WARN"}
