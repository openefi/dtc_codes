{"code":"P0160","description":"O2 Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected (Bank 2 Sensor 2)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","This code is for a post-catalyst oxygen sensor that isn't operating porperly or not at all. The catalyst, or catalytic converter is used to control emissions. This particular o2 sensor on Bank 2, position 2 is after the converter on bank 2 and monitors the catalyst efficiency of the catalytic converter on that bank.","\nÂ ","The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) compares the post-cat o2 sensor to the pre-cat o2 sensors to measure the cat's efficiency. The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a reference voltage to the sensor of about half a volt and also supplies a sensor ground. 12 volts are supplied for the heater element and also a ground for the heater element (the heater in the sensor helps the sensor to warm up faster which allows the engine to reach closed loop sooner).","The sensor varies the reference voltage the PCM gives it based on oxygen content of the exhaust. The change in oxygen content causes resistance changes in the sensor which affects the 0.5 volt reference voltage. Oxygen sensors are capable of varying the supplied voltage between 0.1 volts to 0.9 volts. Lean exhaust produces low voltage and causes the supplied 0.5 volts to drop. Rich exhaust produces high voltage and causes the supplied 0.5 voltage to increase. Pre-catalyst (front) o2 sensors switch between low and high voltage rapidly one or two times per second.","However this sensor is a post-cat o2 sensor and may switch much slower & not vary as much (this is normal). If the sensor \"sticks\" or there are too few switches in a given time period, P0160 may set."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nMay idle or drive poorly\nFuel economy may decrease"],"causes":["Potential causes of an P0160 code include:","Holes in exhaust near post cat o2 sensor\nBad Bank 2, position 2, o2 sensor\nWiring problem, melted harness, broken connectors, etc.\nBad PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
