{"code":"P0102","description":"Mass or Volume Air Flow Circuit Low","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a mass airflow sensor. Brands include but are not limited to Toyota, Infiniti, Nissan, Jaguar, Audi, Mercedes, Dodge, Hyundai, Chevy, Ford, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The MAF (mass air flow) sensor is a sensor mounted in a vehicle's engine air intake tract downstream from the air filter, and is used to measure the volume and density of air being drawn into the engine. The MAF sensor itself only measures a portion of the air entering and that value is used to calculate the total volume and density of air being ingested.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) uses that reading along with other sensor parameters to ensure proper fuel delivery at any given time for optimum power and fuel efficiency.","This P0102 diagnostic trouble code (DTC) means that there is a low condition detected in the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor or circuit. The PCM detects that the actual MAF sensor frequency signal is not performing within the normal expected range of the calculated MAF value.","Note: Some MAF sensors also incorporate an air temperature sensor, which is another value used by the PCM for optimal engine operation.","Closely related MAF circuit trouble codes include P0100, P0101, P0103, and P0104."],"symptoms":["Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination (a.k.a. check engine light)\nRough running engine\nBlack smoke from tail pipe\nStalling\nEngine hard start or stalling after it starts\nPossible other driveability symptoms or even no symptoms"],"causes":[],"type":"WARN"}
