{"code":"P0603","description":"Internal Control Module Keep Alive Memory (KAM) Error","info":["This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model.","The keep alive memory is the memory that is stored in the powertrain control module (PCM) in regards to drive cycles. This memory is ever changing based on driving inputs and sensor inputs. When you disconnect your battery this memory is erased and the computer goes into \"dumb\" mode as it is using the built in parameters to run the engine and not the learned values based on driving inputs and habits as well as what the engine sensors see.","\n ","This is different than \"limp\" mode as the PCM is not seeing a fault. The PCM memory hasn’t adapted to the needed engine parameters. As stated this is NOT the hard programmed values but the ever-changing values that help for fuel economy, smooth running, easier starts, etc. This data is an adaptive formula used by the PCM to improve engine performance, shift fuel, fuel trims, etc.","Other internal control module error trouble codes include:","P0601 Internal Control Module Memory Check Sum Error\nP0602 Control Module Programming Error\nP0604 Internal Control Module Random Access Memory (RAM) Error\nP0605 Internal Control Module Read Only Memory (ROM) Error"],"symptoms":[],"causes":["Potential causes may include:","Battery terminal corrosion or loose connections\nKeep Alive Power (KAPWR) circuit wire routing\nOpen wire in the KAPWR circuit\nDamaged PCM, water intrusion / internal fault\nCharging system fault\nIgnition system fault causing secondary ignition voltage inference\nInternal PCM program fault"],"type":"ERR"}
