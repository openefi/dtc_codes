{"code":"P0646","description":"A/C Clutch Relay Control Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from GM, Chrysler, Chevrolet, Dodge, Jeep, Cadillac, Ford, Ram, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","The P0646 OBD-II trouble code is associated with the air conditioning (A/C) clutch relay control circuit. When the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or one of the other supporting control modules has detected improper signals within the A/C clutch relay control electrical circuit, code P0646 will be set. Based on the vehicle and the specific malfunction this code may be set as many as eight times before the check engine light is illuminated.","The purpose of the A/C clutch relay control circuit is to control the operation of the air conditioning. This is accomplished by providing power to the A/C clutch to engage the A/C compressor. Based on the specific vehicle, this circuit can be very complex and include several control modules.","Code P0646 is set by the PCM when it detects a low voltage situation within the air conditioning relay control circuit."],"symptoms":["A/C functioning poorly\nA/C not working at all\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Faulty A/C clutch relay\nDefective A/C clutch\nBroken control module ground strap\nDefective control module\nBlown fuse or fuse-able link (if applicable)\nCorroded or damaged connector\nLow or over serviced A/C system\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nFaulty A/C Compressor\nFaulty PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
