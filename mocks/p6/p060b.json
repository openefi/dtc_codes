{"code":"P060B","description":"Internal Control Module A/D Processing Performance","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Dodge, Duramax, GMC, Chevrolet, Isuzu, Ram, etc.","\nÂ ","When a code P060B is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal processor error; from a particular set of processors (designated as A/D). Other controllers may also detect a PCM processor performance error and cause a code of this type to be stored.","The internal control module monitoring processors are responsible for various controller self-test duties and overall internal control module accountability. Internal controller (especially PCM) temperature, as well as multiple input and output signals are constantly monitored by specific controller processors.","Whenever the ignition is on and the PCM is energized, numerous internal controller processing self-tests are initiated. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) also compares signals from each individual module to ensure that each controller is functioning properly. These tests are performed simultaneously.","If the PCM detects a discrepancy between any of the on-board controllers, which would indicate an internal processor error, a code P060B will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination, depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction."],"symptoms":["Multiple drivability issues\nHarsh or erratic automatic transmission shifting\nReduction in fuel efficiency\nRough idle or stall\nHesitation upon acceleration"],"causes":["Defective controller or programming error\nBad controller fuse or power supply relay\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
