{"code":"P065A","description":"Generator System Performance","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Land Rover, Honda, Jeep, Subaru, VW, Ford, Chrysler, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P065A means that the powertrain control module (PCM), or one of the other related controllers, has detected a low output condition in the generator system.","In some cases, the alternator is called the generator but more frequently this type of code is used in a hybrid or electric vehicle which generates electrical power from a generator. The generator may be driven by the engine or any of the drive wheels.","The PCM monitors generator output voltage and amperage at varying RPM levels and load degrees and calculates voltage requirements accordingly. In addition to monitoring generator output (performance), the PCM is also responsible for providing a signal that activates the generator lamp in the event of low output.","If a problem is detected in monitoring generator performance, a code P065A will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","Example of an alternator (generator):\n"],"symptoms":["Delayed or no start\nElectrical accessories may be inoperative\nEngine drivability issues"],"causes":["Defective generator\nBad fuse, relay, or fusible link\nOpen or shorted circuit between the PCM and generator\nPCM programming error\nFaulty controller or PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
