{"code":"P065B","description":"Generator Control Circuit Range/Performance","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Land Rover, Chevrolet, Dodge, GMC, Ram, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P065B means that the powertrain control module (PCM), or one of the other related controllers, has detected a discrepancy in the generator control circuit.","In some cases, the alternator is called the generator but more frequently this type of code is used in a hybrid or electric vehicle which generates electrical power from a generator. The generator may be driven by the engine or any of the drive wheels.","Vehicles which utilize this type of code route generator supply voltage through the PCM. This means that the battery voltage that is required to power up the generator field coil (so that it can to produce amperage) is supplied only after the PCM has input the appropriate signal to a relay or auxiliary control module. The PCM also monitors generator output voltage and amperage at varying RPM levels and load degrees and calculates voltage requirements accordingly. In addition to monitoring generator output (performance), the PCM is responsible for providing a signal that activates the generator lamp in the event of low output.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the generator control circuit, a code P065B will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","Example of an alternator (generator):\n"],"symptoms":["Delayed or no start\nElectrical accessories may be inoperative\nEngine drivability issues"],"causes":["Defective generator\nBad fuse, relay, or fusible link\nOpen or shorted circuit between the PCM and generator\nPCM programming error\nFaulty controller or PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
