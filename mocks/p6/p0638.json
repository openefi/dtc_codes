{"code":"P0638","description":"Throttle Actuator Control Range/Performance (Bank 1)","info":["Some newer vehicles are equipped with drive by wire systems - where the throttle body is controlled by a sensor on the gas pedal, the Powertrain Control Module / Engine Control Module (PCM/ECM), and an electric actuator motor in the throttle body.","\nÂ ","The PCM/ECM uses the throttle position sensor (TPS) to monitor the actual throttle blade position and when the actual position is out of range with the target position, the PCM/ECM will set the DTC P0638. Bank 1 refers to the side of the engine with cylinder number one, however most vehicles use one throttle body for all cylinders. This code is similar to code P0639.","Most throttle bodies of this type are not serviceable and need to be replaced. The throttle body is spring actuated to hold at an open position in the event of a motor failure, in some cases with a complete failure the throttle will be unresponsive and the vehicle will only be capable of driving at a slow speed.","Note: If there are any DTC codes associated with the throttle position sensor, be sure to correct those before diagnosing the P0638 code."],"symptoms":["Check Engine Light illuminated (Malfunction Indicator Lamp)\nThe vehicle may feel like it hesitates on acceleration"],"causes":["Pedal position sensor malfunction\nThrottle position sensor malfunction\nThrottle actuator motor malfunction\nDirty throttle body\nWiring harness, loose or dirty connections\nPCM/ECM Malfunction"],"type":"ERR"}
