{"code":"P067B","description":"Cylinder #4 Glow Plug Circuit High","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Jeep, Chrysler, BMW, Toyota, Volkswagen, Dodge, Ram, Ford, Chevrolet, Mazda, etc.","\nÂ ","When a code P067B is set, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a high voltage situation within the glow plug control circuit for cylinder #4. Consult a reliable vehicle service resource to determine the location of said cylinder in the code description for your particular year, make, model, and engine configuration.","Diesel engines use high compression instead of spark to initiate piston movement. Since there is no spark involved, cylinder temperature must be increased to maximize compression. Glow plugs are used in each cylinder to accomplish this increase.","Often confused with spark plugs, a glow plug for each individual cylinder is threaded into the cylinder head. Battery voltage is applied to the glow plug element via a glow plug timer (sometimes called a glow plug controller or glow plug module) and/or the PCM. When voltage is correctly applied to the glow plug, it will literally glow red hot and aid in increasing cylinder temperature. Once cylinder temperature reaches the desired level, voltage is restricted by the control unit and the glow plug returns to its normal state.","If the PCM detects a level of voltage for the cylinder #4 glow plug control circuit that is higher than expected, a code P067B will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","Example photo of a glow plug:\n"],"symptoms":["Excessive black smoke from exhaust\nEngine drivability issues\nDelayed engine start up\nReduced fuel efficiency\nEngine misfire codes may be stored"],"causes":["Bad glow plug/s\nOpen or shorted glow plug control circuit\nLoose or faulty glow plug connector\nDefective glow plug timer"],"type":"WARN"}
