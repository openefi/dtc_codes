{"code":"P0650","description":"Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) Control Circuit","info":["This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model.","This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is set when the vehicle's Powertrain Control Module detects a fault with the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) electrical circuit.","\nÂ ","The MIL is commonly referred to as the \"Check Engine Light\" or \"Service Engine Soon\" light. MIL is the correct term, however. Basically what happens on some vehicles is the vehicles' PCM senses too high or low, or no voltage present through the M.I. lamp. The PCM controls the lamp by monitoring the ground circuit of the lamp and checks the voltage on that ground circuit.","Note: It is normal operation for the malfunction indicator lamp to illuminate for a few seconds and then go out when the ignition is turned on or the car is started."],"symptoms":["Malfunction indicator lamp NOT illuminating when it should (check engine light or service engine soon light)\nMIL being illuminated all the time"],"causes":["Potential causes may include:","Burned out MIL bulb/LED\nMIL wiring problem (short or open electrical condition)\nPoor electrical connection at the bulb/cluster/PCM\nFailed/faulty PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
