{"code":"P0618","description":"Alternative Fuel Control Module KAM Error","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Volkswagen VW, Ford, Nissan, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0618 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction with the alternative fuel control module (AFCM). The issue has occurred in the keep-alive memory (KAM) portion of the AFCM/PCM.","The P0618 code is limited to vehicles that use alternative fuels such as natural gas and electricity for propulsion.","In some cases, the AFCM and PCM may be separate from one another. More often, they are integrated into a single module. This increases controller efficiency in addition to saving automakers space, time, and money.","KAM allows the PCM and other controllers to retain data even when the ignition is turned off or battery power is interrupted briefly.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","In monitoring AFCM/PCM KAM capacity, if a problem is detected, a code P0618 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","Example photo of a fuel pump control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nEngine stall when idling\nDelayed engine cranking (especially when cold)\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty AFCM/PCM\nAFCM/PCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed AFCM/PCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
