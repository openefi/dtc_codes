{"code":"P0622","description":"Generator Field F Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Jeep, Chevy, Ford, Land Rover, Toyota, Ram, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0622 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction with the generator field coil control circuit. The F simply reiterates the field coil control circuit is at fault.","The field coil is probably most recognizable from its windings which are visible through the vent holes on most alternators. The field coil surrounds the generator armature and remains stationary in the alternator housing.","The PCM monitors the continuity and voltage level of the generator field control circuit whenever the engine is running. The generator field coil is integral to generator operation and maintaining battery charge levels.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interfacing properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the generator field control circuit, a code P0622 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated,. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A typical alternator:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nEngine stall when idling\nInadvertent engine shutoff\nDelayed engine cranking\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted generator field control circuit\nDefective alternator/generator"],"type":"ERR"}
