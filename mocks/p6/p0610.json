{"code":"P0610","description":"Control Module Vehicle Options Error","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Jeep, Mazda, Ford, Dodge, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0610 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal control module issue. The malfunction is related to the portion of the PCM that recognizes, monitors, and controls specific vehicle options.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) also compares signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are communicating properly.","If the PCM fails to recognize vehicle equipment options or if certain option characteristics do not match the vehicle identification number (and other protocol), a code P0610 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nErratic (automatic) transmission shifting\nOther stored codes\nDiminished fuel efficiency"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed PCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
