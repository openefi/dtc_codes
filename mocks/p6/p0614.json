{"code":"P0614","description":"ECM/TCM Incompatible","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, VW, Nissan, Volvo Mazda, Audi, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0614 means that a compatibility issue has occurred between the engine control module (ECM) and the transmission control module (TCM).","In some cases, the ECM and TCM may be separate from one another. More often, they are integrated into a single module known as the powertrain control module (PCM). This increases controller effectiveness in addition to saving automakers space, time, and money.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","In monitoring ECM/TCM compatibility, if a discrepancy is detected, a code P0614 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","Example of a transmission control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nEngine stall or no-start\nErratic transmission shift patterns\nHarsh transmission shifting\nInoperable or inaccurate speedometer/odometer\nOther stored ECM/TCM codes"],"causes":["Faulty ECM/TCM\nECM/TCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed ECM/TCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"INFO"}
