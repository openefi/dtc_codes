{"code":"P0655","description":"Engine Hot Lamp Output Control Circuit Malfunction","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, MG, Dodge, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ford, GMC, Opel, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0655 means that the powertrain control module (PCM), or one of the other related controllers, has detected a discrepancy in the engine hot lamp output control circuit.","The engine hot lamp is designed to provide the driver with a visual warning lamp when the engine is overheating. The engine hot lamp is integral to the instrument panel. The PCM receives a signal from the engine coolant temperature sensor. This signal allows the PCM to monitor engine coolant temperature whenever the engine is running or the ignition switch is in the ON position. This data is used primarily for calculating engine fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy and then output to the engine hot lamp and/or instrument panel controller. It may also be output to other controllers. For instance, the engine hot lamp control circuit may be output to the climate control module so that the air conditioning compressor can be disabled if the engine overheats.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the engine hot lamp output control circuit, a code P0655 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","Typical simple gauges:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nInoperative engine hot lamp\nEngine hot lamp is illuminated constantly"],"causes":["Open or shorted circuit between the PCM and the instrument panel or other controllers\nPCM programming error\nFaulty controller or PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
