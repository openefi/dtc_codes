{"code":"P0690","description":"ECM/PCM Power Relay Sense Circuit High","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevrolet, Ford, VW, Jeep, Audi, Chrysler, Dodge, Cadillac, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","When a code P0690 is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM), has detected an abnormality in the relay which supplies it with voltage. This particular code will be stored if power relay sensor circuit voltage exceeds the maximum allowable parameter.","The PCM power relay is used to apply battery voltage safely to the appropriate PCM circuits. It is a contact type relay that is activated with a signal wire from the ignition switch. This type of relay typically uses a five-wire design. Constant battery voltage is applied on one wire; ground on another. A third circuit carries a signal from the ignition switch and a fourth supplies voltage to the PCM. The fifth wire is the power relay sense circuit. It is used by the PCM to monitor power relay voltage.","If the PCM detects a high voltage condition on the power relay sense circuit, a code P0690 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A typical PCM powertrain control module, opened up:\n"],"symptoms":["Delayed or no start\nElectrical accessories may be inoperative\nEngine drivability issues"],"causes":["Defective PCM power relay\nBlown fuse or fusible link\nOpen or shorted circuit between the power relay and the PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
