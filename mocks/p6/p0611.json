{"code":"P0611","description":"Fuel Injector Control Module Performance","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford (Powerstroke), Hyundai, Toyota, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0611 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an internal control module performance issue. The malfunction is related to the portion of the PCM that controls fuel injector function.","In some cases, the fuel injector controller may be separate from the PCM. Most frequently, it is integrated into the PCM. This saves automakers space, time, and money.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","If the PCM finds that fuel injector function cannot be effectively controlled, a code P0611 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A fuel pump control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Engine drivability issues\nReduced engine performance\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty PCM\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed PCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
