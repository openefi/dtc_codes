{"code":"P064A","description":"Fuel Pump Control Module","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P064A means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the fuel pump control module.","The fuel pump control module is responsible for supply and regulation of voltage to the fuel pump relay and the fuel pump. In most cases, the fuel pump controller is integrated into the PCM but it may also be a stand-alone module. The fuel pump provides pressurized fuel for the fuel injection system. It is most often located inside the fuel tank.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. By performing internal controller self-tests, the PCM can monitor serial data that is carried over the controller area network (CAN) to ensure that on-board controllers are interfacing properly.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the fuel pump control module, a code P064A will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","A typical fuel pump:\n"],"symptoms":["Delayed engine starting\nNo-start condition\nEngine drivability issues\nOther stored codes"],"causes":["Faulty fuel pump controller or PCM\nOpen fuel pump control module voltage supply circuit\nBad or tripped fuel pump voltage shutoff switch\nPCM programming error\nOpen or shorted fuel pump control circuit"],"type":"ERR"}
