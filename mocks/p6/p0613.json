{"code":"P0613","description":"TCM Processor","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to many OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Audi, Land Rover, etc.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0613 means that the transmission control module (TCM) has detected an internal control processor malfunction.","In some cases, the TCM may be separate from the powertrain control module (PCM). Most frequently, it is integrated into the PCM. This saves automakers space, time, and money.","Each time the ignition is turned on and the PCM is energized, multiple controller self-tests are performed. In addition to running internal controller self-tests, the controller area network (CAN) is used to compare signals from each individual module to ensure that the various controllers are interacting properly.","In monitoring TCM function, if the PCM detects a problem, a code P0613 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Depending upon the perceived severity of the malfunction, multiple failure cycles may be necessary for MIL illumination.","A transmission control module:\n"],"symptoms":["Erratic transmission shift patterns\nHarsh transmission shifting\nInoperable or inaccurate speedometer/odometer\nOther stored TCM/PCM codes"],"causes":["Faulty TCM/PCM\nTCM/PCM programming error\nOpen or shorted circuit or connectors in the CAN harness\nFailed TCM/PCM power source\nInsufficient control module ground"],"type":"ERR"}
