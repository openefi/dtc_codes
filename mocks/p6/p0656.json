{"code":"P0656","description":"Fuel Level Output Circuit Malfunction","info":["This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Saturn, Ford, GMC, Mercedes Benz, Holden, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P0656 means that the powertrain control module (PCM), or one of the other related controllers, has detected a discrepancy in the fuel level output circuit.","The fuel level gauge is an integral part of the instrument panel. With it the driver can monitor the vehicle fuel level when operating the vehicle. Typically, the PCM receives a signal from the fuel level sensor (in the fuel storage tank). This signal allows the PCM to calculate fuel mileage and monitor fuel tank pressure as well as fuel temperature. This data is used to calculate engine fuel delivery strategy and then the fuel level output signal is provided to the fuel gauge and/or instrument panel controller. It may also be output to the low fuel lamp and other on-board controllers.","If a problem is detected in monitoring the fuel level output circuit, a code P0656 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.","Typical simple gauges:\n"],"symptoms":["Inoperative fuel level gauge\nLow fuel lamp is inoperative\nLow fuel lamp remains illuminated\nEngine drivability issues\nFuel temperature codes\nEvaporative emission system codes"],"causes":["Open or shorted circuit between the PCM and the instrument panel or other controllers\nPCM programming error\nFaulty controller or PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
