{"code":"P0008","description":"Engine Positions System Performance Bank 1","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet, etc.","Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","This source has a good description of this P0008 code:","\nÂ ","\"The Engine Control Module (ECM) tests for misalignment between both camshafts on one bank of the engine & the crankshaft. The misalignment would be at an idler sprocket for either bank or at the crankshaft. Once the ECM learns the position of both camshafts on one bank of the engine, the ECM compares the learned values to a reference value. The ECM will set a DTC if both learned values for one bank of the engine are exceeding a calibrated threshold in the same direction.\"","The code is more common in the following makes: Suzuki, GM, Cadillac, Buick, Holden. In fact, there are service bulletins for certain GM vehicles and the fix is to replace timing chains (including such engines as 3.6 LY7, 3.6 LLT or 2.8 LP1). You may also see this DTC in a vehicle that also has other related DTCs such as P0009, P0016, P0017, P0018, and P0019. Bank 1 refers to the side of the engine that contains cylinder #1."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nRoughness while accelerating\nPoor fuel economy\nDecreased power\nTiming chain \"noise\""],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0008 code may include:","Stretched timing chain\nCrankshaft reluctor wheel has moved and is no longer referenced to top dead center (TDC)\nTiming chain tensioner problem"],"type":"ERR"}
