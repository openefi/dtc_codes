{"code":"P0042","description":"HO2S Heater Control Circuit (Bank 1 Sensor 3)","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to VW Volkswagen, Audi, Mazda, Ford, Chevy, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Fuel injected vehicles use heated oxygen sensors in the exhaust system before and after the catalytic converters to determine oxygen content. This feedback is used to adjust the fuel system accordingly to maintain a proper air/fuel ratio of 14.7:1.","\nÂ ","The oxygen sensors used a heated circuit to warm up the sensor for faster feedback operation. The oxygen sensor may use three or four wires depending on the vehicle, two are usually used for the sensor feedback to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) / Engine Control Module (ECM) and the other wires are for the heater to power the heated circuit. Three wire sensors are usually grounded through the exhaust system, and four wire sensors have a seperate ground wire.","The P0042 code refers to the third sensor downstream from the engine on bank 1, which is on the side of the engine with the #1 cylinder. The heater circuit may be supplied power or ground by the PCM/ECM or another source that can be controlled by the PCM/ECM.","Note: Be careful not to work around an exhaust system that has been ran recently as they can become very hot."],"symptoms":[],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0042 trouble code may include:","Open circuit inside oxygen sensor or open power or ground wires to bank 1, #3 oxygen sensor\nExhaust system ground strap may have become corroded or broken\nPCM/ECM or oxygen sensor heater circuit wiring has failed"],"type":"ERR"}
