{"code":"P00AD","description":"Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit High Bank 2","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the temperature of the air entering the engine. The PCM supplies a 5 volt reference voltage to the Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor","\nÂ ","The IAT is a thermistor that varies resistance based on temperature. As the temperature increases, resistance decreases. Low temperature results in a high signal voltage. When the PCM sees a signal voltage higher than 5 volts for the bank 2 IAT sensor, it sets this P00AD check engine light code. Bank 2 is the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.","Related Bank 2 IAT sensor circuit trouble codes include:","P00AA Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Bank 2\nP00AB Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Range/Performance Bank 2\nP00AC Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Low Bank 2\nP00AE Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Intermittent/Erratic Bank 2"],"symptoms":["There will likely be no symptoms other than illumination of the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL - Check Engine Light / Service Engine Soon)."],"causes":["A code P00AD may mean that one or more of the following has happened:","Internally failed bank 2 IAT sensor\nFaulty connection at bank 2 IAT sensor\nOpen in IAT ground circuit or signal circuit\nShort to voltage in IAT signal circuit or reference circuit\nIAT harness and/or wiring routed too close to high-voltage wiring (e.g. alternator, spark plug cables, etc.)\nFaulty PCM (less likely but not impossible)"],"type":"WARN"}
