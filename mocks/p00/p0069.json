{"code":"P0069","description":"Manifold Absolute Pressure - Barometric Pressure Correlation","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBDII equipped engines, but shows up more often in certain Audi, Ford, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Saturn and VW vehicles.","The Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor converts engine vacuum into an electrical signal for the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). The engine may also have a Barometric Pressure (BARO or just BP) sensor to convert atmospheric pressure into an electrical signal to the PCM","\n ","The PCM receives these inputs and possibly two more; Mass Airflow (MAF) and Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) to determine load and altitude. The PCM looks at the MAP sensor voltage and compares it to the BARO sensor reading when the ignition switch is first turned on. This code is set if these inputs vary too much. It also looks at the voltage signals from the MAP and BARO sensors to determine if they are correct when the throttle is at the wide open position. This would once again indicate barometric pressure.","This code could have been set due to mechanical or electrical issues. Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of MAP/BP sensor and wire colors."],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nHesitation during acceleration\nDecrease in fuel economy"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0069 trouble code may include:","Poor running engine / basic engine performance neglect – common\nPlugged vacuum line between intake manifold and MAP sensor – common\nFailed MAP or BARO sensor - possible\nFailed PCM - unlikely"],"type":"ERR"}
