{"code":"P000B","description":"B Camshaft Position Slow Response Bank 1","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II vehicles equipped with variable valve/cam timing. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Subaru, Dodge, VW, Audi, Jeep, GMC, Chevrolet, Saturn, Chrysler, Ford, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Many modern vehicles use variable valve timing (VVT) to improve engine performance and fuel economy. In a VVT system, the powertrain control module (PCM) controls solenoid-operated oil control valves. These valves apply oil pressure to an actuator mounted between the camshaft and timing chain sprocket. In turn, the actuator then alters the angular position, or phase change, of the camshaft. A camshaft position sensor is used to monitor camshaft position.","\nÂ ","A camshaft position slow response code is set when actual camshaft position does not match the position desired by the PCM during camshaft phase changes.","As it pertains to trouble code descriptions, the \"A\" indicates the intake, left or front camshaft. On the other hand, \"B\" indicates the exhaust, right or rear camshaft. Bank 1 is the side of the engine that contains the #1 cylinder, whereas bank 2 is the opposite bank. If the engine is an inline or straight design, there is only one bank.","Code P000B is set when the PCM detects a slow response in camshaft position phase change from bank 1 circuit \"B\". This code is related to P000A, P000C, and P000D."],"symptoms":["Illuminated check engine light\nIncreased emissions\nPoor engine performance\nEngine noise"],"causes":["Improper oil supply\nFaulty camshaft position sensor\nFailed oil control valve\nFailed VVT actuator\nTiming chain problems\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM","An example of a camshaft position (CMP) sensor:\n"],"type":"ERR"}
