{"code":"P0070","description":"Ambient Air Temperature Sensor Circuit","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all OBDII equipped engines, but shows up more often in certain Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Jeep, Mazda, Mitsubishi, and VW vehicles.","The Ambient Air Temperature (AAT) sensor converts ambient air temperature into an electrical signal for the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). This input is used to modify air conditioning system operation and display outside air temperature.","\nÂ ","The PCM receives this input and possibly two more; Intake Air Temperature (IAT) and Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor (ECT). The PCM looks at the AAT sensor voltage and compares it to the IAT/ECT sensor readings when the ignition switch is first turned on after a long cool down period. This code is set if these inputs vary too much. It also looks at the voltage signals from these sensors to determine if they are correct when the engine is fully warmed up.","This code is usually set due to electrical issues. Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of AAT sensor and wire colors."],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nAir Conditioning may not perform properly\nInstrument cluster may not read outside temperature accurately\nOverhead console may not read outside temperature accurately"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0070 trouble code may include:","Open in the signal circuit to the AAT sensor\nShort to voltage in the signal circuit to the AAT sensor\nShort to ground in the signal circuit to the AAT sensor\nAAT sensor faulty\nFailed PCM - unlikely"],"type":"ERR"}
