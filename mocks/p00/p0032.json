{"code":"P0032","description":"Generic: Oxygen (A/F) Sensor Heater Control Circuit High (Bank 1 Sensor 1)\nNissan: Heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) 1 Bank 1 - heater voltage high","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to Nissan, Toyota, VW, Ford, Dodge, Honda, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Audi, Acura, etc. Specific repair steps may vary depending on the model.","A P0032 DTC (diagnostic trouble code) refers to the O2 sensor (oxygen sensor) located on Bank 1 in front of the catalytic converter. There is also an oxygen sensor behind the converter which is Sensor #2.","\nÂ ","This O2 sensor #1 may also be refered to as an air/fuel ratio sensor since on some vehicles it is. The sensor detects the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas compared to the outside air and then vehicle's computer adjusts the air/fuel ratio going into the engine. The sensor is less effective when the exhaust gas temperature is low, so it includes a heater which is activated to help get better readings from the O2 sensor. Essentially this P0032 code means that the resistance of the heater circuit is higher than normal. In some cases, that resistance level must be higher than 10 A to trigger the DTC code.","Note, this code is very similar in nature to P0031, P0051, and P0052"],"symptoms":["Most likely you'll not notice any symptoms other than the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) will illuminate."],"causes":["A P0032 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:","A short in the heater circuit in the sensor\nA failed O2 sensor heater\nWiring/connectors broken/frayed leading to sensor and/or relay\nFailed PCM/ECM"],"type":"WARN"}
