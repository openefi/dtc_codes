{"code":"P0004","description":"Fuel Volume Regulator Control Circuit High","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to Ford, Dodge, Vauxhall, VW, Mazda, etc. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","A P0004 is not a very common trouble code and is more often seen on common rail diesel (CRD) and/or diesel engine, and gasoline direct injection (GDI) equipped vehicles.","\nÂ ","This code relates to the the electrical system as part of the fuel volume regulator system. Automotive fuel systems consist of many components, the fuel tank, fuel pump, filter, lines, injectors, etc. One component in high pressure fuel systems is a high pressure fuel pump. It's job is to increase the fuel pressure for the very high pressure needed at the fuel rail for the injectors. These high pressure fuel pumps have a low pressure side and high pressure side, and a fuel volume regulator which controls the pressure. For this P0004 code, it refers to an electrical reading that is above expected parameters.","This code is related to P0001, P0002, and P0003."],"symptoms":["Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination\nVehicle won't start\n\"Limp mode\" enabled and/or lack of power"],"causes":["Potential causes of this engine code may include:","Failed fuel volume regulator (FVR) solenoid\nFVR wiring/harness electrical problem (wiring short, corrosion, etc.)"],"type":"WARN"}
