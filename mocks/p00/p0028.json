{"code":"P0028","description":"Intake Valve Control Solenoid Circuit Range/Performance Bank 2","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles, including but not limited to Toyota, VW, Ford, Dodge, Honda, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Audi, Acura, etc. Specific repair steps may vary depending on the model.","\nÂ ","On vehicles equipped with variable valve timing (VVT), camshafts are controlled by hydraulic actuators fed by the engine oil system through control solenoids by the engine control module/powertrain control module (ECM/PCM). The ECM/PCM has detected the range of movement of the intake camshaft on Bank 2 is out of specifications or not operating when commanded. Bank 2 refers to the side of the engine opposite from cylinder #1 - be sure to verify which side is correct according to manufacturers specifications. The intake valve control solenoid is typically located on the intake manifold side of the cylinder head.","Note: This code may also be associated with codes P0081, P0082 or P0083 - if any of these codes exist, fix the solenoid problem before proceeding with diagnosing the circuit range/performance issue. This code is similar to codes P0026, P0027, and P0029."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nPoor acceleration or engine performance\nDecreased fuel economy"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0028 diagnostic trouble code may include:","Low engine oil level or contaminated oil\nClogged oil system\nMalfunctioning control solenoid\nMalfunctioning camshaft actuator\nTiming chain/belt loose or incorrectly adjusted\nMalfunctioning ECM/PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
