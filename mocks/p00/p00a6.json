{"code":"P00A6","description":"Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor 2 Circuit Range/Performance Bank 2","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles. Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","The IAT (Intake Air Temperature) sensor is a thermistor that varies resistance based upon the temperature of the engine intake air. It is typically located in the air intake ductwork and is usually a two wire sensor. One wire is supplied 5 Volt from the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) and the other is a ground. The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the change in the 5 volt supplied to determine air temperature to run the engine at the most efficient conditions possible at the given temperature.","\nÂ ","When the intake air is cold, the resistance is high, resulting in a high signal voltage. Conversely, when the intake air is warm, the resistance is low, resulting in a low signal voltage. This code means that the PCM saw a larger-than-normal change in a shorter-than-expected time on the #2 IAT signal circuit on bank 2. Bank 2 is the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.","Related Bank 2 IAT sensor 2 trouble codes include:","P00A5 Intake Air Temperature Sensor 2 Circuit Bank 2\nP00A7 Intake Air Temperature Sensor 2 Circuit Low Bank 2\nP00A8 Intake Air Temperature Sensor 2 Circuit High Bank 2\nP00A9 Intake Air Temperature Sensor 2 Circuit Intermittent/Erratic Bank 2"],"symptoms":["Since this code is likely pointing to an intermittent problem on the IAT circuit, there may not be any symptoms at present. However, the MIL will likely be on. The car MAY exhibit some drivability problems, but it is more likely that there will be no noticeable symptoms to the driver."],"causes":["Potential causes of the P00A6 DTC include:","a bad #2 IAT sensor\nan open in the signal or ground circuit\na short to ground on the signal circuit\npoor connection at sensor or PCM"],"type":"ERR"}
