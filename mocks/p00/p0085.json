{"code":"P0085","description":"Exhaust Valve Control Solenoid Circuit Low (Bank 2)","info":["This code is a generic OBD-II powertrain code, that means it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may vary depending on the model.","\nÂ ","On vehicles equipped with variable valve timing (VVT), the Engine Control Module / Powertrain Control Module (ECM/PCM) controls the camshaft position by regulating the engine oil through the control solenoid to change the position of the camshaft. The control solenoid is commanded using a Pulse Width Modulated signal (PWM) from the ECM/PCM. The ECM/PCM monitors this signal and if the voltage is below specification, it will set this trouble code and illuminate the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL).","Bank 2 refers to the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1 - be sure to verify according to manufacturers specifications. The exhaust valve control solenoid is usually located on the Exhaust manifold side of the cylinder head. This code is similar to codes P0084 and P0086. This code may also be accompanied by P0029."],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nPoor acceleration\nDecreased fuel economy"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0085 diagnostic trouble code may include:","Wire harness shorted to ground\nSolenoid shorted to ground\nFaulty ECM"],"type":"WARN"}
