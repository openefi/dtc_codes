{"code":"P00BF","description":"P00BF Mass or Volume Air Flow \"B\" Circuit Range/Performance - Air Flow Too High","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles with a Mass or Volume Air Flow sensor (BMW, Ford, Mazda, Jaguar, Mini, Land Rover, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model, and/or powertrain.","The mass air flow (MAF) sensor is a sensor mounted in a vehicle's engine air intake tract downstream from the air filter, and is used to measure the volume and density of air being drawn into the engine. The MAF sensor itself only measures a portion of the air entering and that value is used to calculate the total volume and density of air being ingested. The MAF may also be called a Volume Air Flow sensor.","\nÂ ","The powertrain control module (PCM) uses that reading along with other sensor parameters to ensure proper fuel delivery at any given time for optimum power and fuel efficiency.","Basically this P00BF diagnostic trouble code (DTC) means that there is a problem with the Mass or Volume Air Flow (MAF) \"B\" sensor circuit. The PCM detects that the actual MAF sensor frequency signal is not within a predetermined expected range of the calculated MAF value, and in this case it's determined that the air flow is too high.","Note the \"B\" part of this code description. That letter denotes either part of the sensor or circuit, or even a single MAF sensor if the vehicle has more than one.","Note: Some MAF sensors also incorporate an air temperature sensor, which is another value used by the PCM for optimal engine operation."],"symptoms":["Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illumination (a.k.a. check engine light)\nEngine running rough\nBlack smoke from tail pipe\nStalling\nEngine hard start or stalling after it starts\nPossible other driveability symptoms"],"causes":["Potential causes for this trouble code may include:","Dirty or contaminated mass air flow sensor\nFailed MAF sensor\nIntake air leaks\nMAF sensor electrical harness or wiring problem (open, shorted, frayed, poor connection, etc.)","Note that other codes may be present if you have a P00BF. You may have misfire codes or O2 sensor codes, so it's important to take a \"big picture\" look at how the systems work together and effect each other when doing a diagnosis."],"type":"WARN"}
