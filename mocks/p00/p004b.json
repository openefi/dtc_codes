{"code":"P004B","description":"Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"B\" Circuit Range Performance","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to OBD-II equipped vehicles that have a supercharger or turbocharger (Ford Powerstroke, Chevrolet GMC Duramax, Toyota, Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, VW, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","Turbochargers and superchargers are air pumps that force air into the engine to increase power. Superchargers are driven off the engine crankshaft by a belt, whereas turbochargers are driven by the engine's exhaust.","\nÂ ","Many modern turbocharged vehicles use what's referred to as a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT).This type of turbo has adjustable vanes located around the outside of the turbine that can be opened and closed to vary the amount of boost pressure. This allows the turbo to be controlled independent of engine speed. Generally, the vanes are open when the engine is under light load and open as load increases. Vane position is controlled by the powertrain control module (PCM), typically using an electronic control solenoid or motor. Turbo vane position is determined using a dedicated position sensor.","On vehicles that use a traditional, fixed displacement turbo charger or supercharger, boost is controlled via a wastegate or bypass valve. This valve opens to relieve boost pressure. The PCM monitors this system using a boost pressure sensor.","In reference to this trouble code, the \"B\" indicates the problem in with a portion of the system circuit, instead of a particular symptom or component.","Code P004B is set when the PCM detects a performance problem with the boost control solenoid, no matter if the engine uses a VGT turbo or traditional turbocharger/supercharger.","One style of turbocharger boost control solenoid valve:\n","Related turbo / supercharger engine trouble codes:","P004A Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"B\" Circuit/Open\nP004C Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"B\" Circuit Low\nP004D Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"B\" Circuit High\nP004F Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"B\" Circuit Intermittent"],"symptoms":["Insufficient boost resulting in lack of engine performance\nOverboost resulting in detonation and possible engine damage\nIlluminated check engine light"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","Faulty boost pressure/ turbocharger position sensor\nFailed turbocharger/super charger\nDefective control solenoid\nWiring problems\nFaulty PCM\nVacuum leaks if the valve is vacuum controlled"],"type":"ERR"}
