{"code":"P201A","description":"Reductant Injection Valve Circuit Range/Performance Bank 2 Unit 1","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Ford, Mercedes Benz, Sprinter, Smart, Ram, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P201A means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected abnormal voltage in the control circuit for the reductant injection valve for engine bank two and selective catalyst reduction (SCR) system one. Bank 2 refers to the bank of the engine that does NOT contain the #1 cylinder.","The catalyst system is responsible for reduction of (basically) all exhaust emissions although certain applications are also equipped with a NOx trap.","Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems go another step further in the reduction of NOx. Nevertheless, today's larger and more powerful diesel engines cannot meet strict federal (U.S.) emission standards with the EGR, diesel particulate filter/catalytic converter, and NOx trap alone. It was for this reason that selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems were invented.","SCR systems inject a reductant compound or a diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) into the exhaust in front of the diesel particulate filter, NOx trap, and/or the catalytic converter via the reductant injection valve (solenoid). The precisely timed DEF injection elevates the temperature of the filtration element and allows it to perform more efficiently. It enhances filtration element longevity and allows fewer harmful exhaust emissions to be released into the atmosphere.","The entire SCR system is monitored and controlled by either the PCM or a stand-alone controller (which interacts with the PCM). Either way, the controller monitors the O2, NOx, and exhaust temperature sensors (as well as other inputs) to determine the appropriate time for DEF (reductant) injection. Precise DEF injection is necessary to maintain exhaust temperature within acceptable parameters and optimize pollutant filtration.","Reductant heaters are used to prevent diesel exhaust fluid from freezing during extreme temperatures. These heaters are typically located in the DEF reservoir and/or the reductant injector supply hose/s.","If the PCM detects voltage on the control circuit for the reductant injection valve that is outside the normal range or performance parameters for engine bank 2 unit one, a code P201A will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated."],"symptoms":["Diminished engine performance\nExcessive black smoke from vehicle exhaust\nReduction in fuel efficiency\nOther SCR related codes"],"causes":["Bad reductant injection valve\nOpen or shorted circuits in the reductant injection valve control\nInsufficient DEF in the reservoir\nBad SCR controller/PCM or programming error"]}
