{"code":"P2061","description":"Reductant Injection Air Pump Control Circuit High","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Dodge, Ram, Sprinter, Mercedes Benz, Ford, Audi, Volkswagen, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P2061 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an excessive voltage in the reductant injection air pump control circuit. The word open could be substituted with disconnected.","Today's larger and more powerful (clean-burning) diesel engines cannot meet strict federal (U.S.) emission standards with only the EGR, diesel particulate filter/catalytic converter, and NOx trap. It was for this reason that selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems were invented.","The SCR system injects a reductant compound or a diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) into the exhaust, along with a measure of air, in front of the diesel particulate filter, NOx trap, and/or the catalytic converter via the reductant injection valve (solenoid). The precisely timed DEF/air injection elevates the temperature of the filtration element and allows it to perform more efficiently. It enhances filtration element longevity and allows fewer harmful exhaust emissions to be released into the atmosphere. The entire SCR system is monitored and controlled by either the PCM or a stand-alone controller (which interacts with the PCM). Either way, the controller monitors the O2, NOx, and exhaust temperature sensors (as well as other inputs) to determine the appropriate time for DEF (reductant) and air injection. Precise DEF injection is necessary to maintain exhaust temperature within acceptable parameters and optimize pollutant filtration.","The reductant/regeneration supply pump is used to pressurize the DEF in the liquid reductant system for use, when required. Supply pump voltage is monitored by the PCM for consistent fluctuation and load percentage. The PCM also monitors one or more pressure sensors in the reductant supply system to determine if there is a leak in the system.","If the PCM detects an excessive voltage in the reductant injection air pump control circuit, a code P2061 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles - with a failure - may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Reduction in fuel efficiency\nExcessive black smoke from vehicle exhaust\nDiminished engine performance\nOther SCR related codes"],"causes":["Defective reductant air pressure sensor\nFaulty reductant injection air pump\nOpen or shorted circuits in the reductant injection air pressure sensor system\nBad SCR controller/PCM or programming error"]}
