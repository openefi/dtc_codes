{"code":"P2024","description":"Evaporative Emissions (EVAP) Fuel Vapor Temperature Sensor Circuit","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Mercedes Benz, VW, Audi, Subaru, Chevy, Dodge, BMW, Suzuki, Hyundai, Sprinter, etc. Anecdotally this code seems to be more commonly found on Mercedes-Benz vehicles.","Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","The Evaporative emissions (EVAP) system was introduced to vehicles for a few different reasons. Some of those included but are not limited to: reduced emissions expelled, slightly improved fuel efficiency, containing otherwise wasted fuel vapors. Not to mention consistently recycling unused/unburned fuel, pretty efficient isn't it?","That being said, the EVAP system requires a multitude of sensors, switches, and valves in order to maintain desired emissions. The ECM (Engine Control Module) actively monitors these and adjusts them according to system needs. Just as the name implies, the fuel vapor temperature sensor is used by the ECM to monitor the temperature of those unburned vapors that would otherwise be expelled to the atmosphere.","It is important to note that the EVAP system uses mostly plastic components to deliver the unburned fuel vapors to the engine to be burnt. You can imagine what kind of issues can occur when you expose plastic to the elements 24/7. Especially in particularly harsh winter conditions, these plastic components tend crack/split/break/clog. Food for thought.","The check engine light gets activated with P2024 and associated codes P2025, P2026, P2027, and P2028, when the ECM recognizes one or more electrical values missing and/or outside of a specific range within the EVAP fuel vapor temperature sensor or in one of the circuits involved. Hard to say wether this would be mechanical or electrical, the thing to keep in mind is, the overall health of the system involved, in this case, the EVAP system, is and always should be the priority.","Code P2024 is activated when the ECM monitors a general malfunction within the EVAP fuel vapor temperature sensor circuit"],"symptoms":["Failed state/provincial emission test\nCEL (check engine light) on\nSlight decrease in fuel efficiency\nFuel smell\nPossible abnormal fuel filling symptoms (lengthy fill ups, cannot pull trigger on gas pump fully, etc.)"],"causes":["Defective EVAP (Evaporative emissions) fuel vapor temperature sensor\nObstruction/leak within system causing sensor to perform out of range (mainly P2025)\nBroken or damaged EVAP fuel vapor temperature sensor wiring harness\nWire shorting to power\nExcessive resistance within the circuit\nECM (Engine Control Module) issue\nPin/connector problem.
