{"code":"P2020","description":"Intake Manifold Runner Position Sensor / Switch Circuit Range/Performance Bank 2","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to fuel injected engines from most manufacturers since 2003.","Those manufacturers include but are not limited to Ford, Dodge, Toyota, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Nissan and Infiniti.","\n ","This code is mostly concerned about the value provided by the intake manifold flow control valve/position sensor, also called known as a IMRC valve/sensor (typically located at one end of the intake manifold) which helps the vehicle’s PCM control the amount of air being allowed into the engine at various RPMs. This code is set for Bank 2, which is the bank of cylinders that does not include cylinder number 1. This can be a mechanical or an electrical circuit fault, depending upon vehicle manufacturer and fuel system.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of fuel system and the type of intake manifold runner control valve/position (IMRC) sensor and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated\nLack of power\nOccasional misfire\nPoor fuel economy"],"causes":["Typically, the causes for this code to set are:","Sticking/faulty throttle plates/body\nSticking/faulty IMRC valve bank 2\nFaulty IMRC actuator/sensor bank 2\nRarely - faulty Powertrain Control Module (PCM)\n(programming required after replacement)"]}
