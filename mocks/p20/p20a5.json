{"code":"P20A5","description":"Reductant Purge Control Valve Stuck Closed","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to many OBD-II diesel powered vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Chevrolet, GMC, Ford, Mitsubishi, VW, Sprinter, Audi, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","OBD-II trouble code P20A5 and related codes P20A0, P20A1, P20A2, P20A3, and P20A4 are associated with the reductant purge control valve circuit. This circuit is also known as the diesel exhaust fluid system (DEF).","The purpose of the reductant purge control valve circuit is to send a signal to Power Control Module (PCM) or the Engine Control Module (ECM) as a reference point to determine when the reductant pump needs to reverse flow and purge the DEF system. This process is used to assist in converting leftover exhaust particles into harmless gases. The DEF system is designed to convert harmful NOx gases to Nitrogen, Carbon Dioxide, and water to protect the environment.","When the PCM or ECM detects a stuck closed reductant purge control valve, code P20A5 will be set and the check engine light will be illuminated.","A mechanic:\n"],"symptoms":["Poor engine performance\nDecreased fuel economy\nCheck engine light illuminated"],"causes":["Defective reductant purge control valve\nFaulty or damaged wiring\nLoose or defective control module ground strap\nCorroded, damaged or loose connector\nDefective fuse or fuse-able link (If applicable)\nDefective PCM or ECM"]}
