{"code":"P205C","description":"Reductant Tank Temperature Sensor Circuit Low","info":["\nÂ ","This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Mercedes, Sprinter, Ford, GMC, Chevrolet, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","A stored code P205C means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an insufficient degree of voltage in the reductant tank temperature sensor circuit. This code is exhibited in vehicles with a clean burning diesel engine, exclusively.","The catalyst system is responsible for reduction of (basically) all exhaust emissions although certain applications are also equipped with a NOx trap.","Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems go another step further in the reduction of NOx. Nevertheless, today's larger and more powerful diesel engines cannot meet strict federal (U.S.) emission standards with the EGR, diesel particulate filter/catalytic converter, and NOx trap alone. It was for this reason that selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems were invented.","SCR systems inject a reductant compound or a diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) into the exhaust in front of the diesel particulate filter, NOx trap, and/or the catalytic converter via the reductant injection valve (solenoid). The precisely timed DEF injection elevates the temperature of the filtration element and allows it to perform more efficiently. It enhances filtration element longevity and allows fewer harmful exhaust emissions to be released into the atmosphere. The entire SCR system is monitored and controlled by either the PCM or a stand-alone controller (which interacts with the PCM). Either way, the controller monitors the O2, NOx, and exhaust temperature sensors (as well as other inputs) to determine the appropriate time for DEF (reductant) injection. Precise DEF injection is necessary to maintain exhaust temperature within acceptable parameters and optimize pollutant filtration.","The reductant/regeneration supply pump is used to pressurize the DEF in the liquid reductant system for use, when required. Supply pump voltage is monitored by the PCM for consistent fluctuation and load percentage. The PCM also monitors one or more pressure sensors in the reductant supply system to determine if there is a leak in the system.","If the PCM detects a degree of voltage in the reductant tank temperature sensor circuit that is too low, below the acceptable parameters within the circuit, a code P205C will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles - with a failure - may be required for MIL illumination.","Example of a DEF reductant tank:\n"],"symptoms":["Reduction in fuel efficiency\nExcessive black smoke from vehicle exhaust\nDiminished engine performance\nOther SCR related codes"],"causes":["Defective reductant tank temperature sensor\nOpen or shorted circuits in the reductant tank temperature sensor system\nBad SCR controller/PCM or programming error"]}
