{"code":"P203E","description":"Reductant Level Sensor Circuit Intermittent/Erratic","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. Vehicle makes may include but aren't limited to BMW, Mercedes Benz, VW Volkswagen, Sprinter, Ford, Audi, Dodge, Ram, GMC, Chevrolet, Jeep, etc.","\nÂ ","Did you know that the engine light comes on whenever the engine's exhaust emissions are outside of specifications? The ECM (Engine control module) monitors and adjusts dozens of sensors, valves, systems, etc. It basically acts like a built-in emissions testing station. It monitors not only what your engine is taking in but, more importantly to the manufacturer, what your engine is pumping into the atmosphere.","This is relevant here because for the most part, reductant level sensors are present on diesel powered vehicles with a DEF (Diesel exhaust fluid) storage tank. DEF is a urea solution used in diesel engines to aid in burning exhaust, in turn reducing overall vehicle emissions, which like mentioned earlier, is one of the most important purposes of the ECM. The reductant level sensor communicates to the ECM the DEF fluid level present in it's storage tank.","P203E is the trouble code defined as \"Reductant Level Sensor Circuit Intermittent/Erratic\" and indicates a detected erratic or intermittent electrical reading from the sensor circuit as identified by the ECM.","A reductant DEF tank:\n"],"symptoms":["Incorrect DEF (Diesel exhaust fluid) level reading\nExhaust emissions outside of specifications\nCEL (Check engine light) on\nExcessive smoke\n\"Low\" or other DEF warning on instrument cluster"],"causes":["Reductant level sensor defective\nWrong fluid in DEF storage tank\nBroken wire or harness causing intermittent electrical connections\nElectrical short"]}
