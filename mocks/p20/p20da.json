{"code":"P20DA","description":"Exhaust Aftertreatment Fuel Supply Control Circuit High","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from VW, Audi, Mercedes Benz, Ford, Mitsubishi, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored a code P20DA in your diesel powered vehicle means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected excess voltage in the fuel supply control circuit for the exhaust aftertreatment system.","The exhaust aftertreatment system (also called selective catalyst reduction system) is used to enhance the capabilities of the exhaust catalyst system. It may consist of one or more of these items; diesel oxidation catalyst, diesel particulate filter, reductant injection system, ammonia slip catalyst, and a nitrogen oxide (NOx) trap.","The reductant injection system is typically composed of at least one reductant injector, a reductant fuel storage tank, and high-pressure reductant fuel lines. A high-pressure, electronic pump is normally situated in the tank or in the fuel supply line. It is within the circuit which controls this supply pump that a malfunction has been perceived when a P20DA is stored.","Among other things, exhaust aftertreatment systems (EAS) are responsible for the injection of reductant compound/diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) into the exhaust in front of the diesel particulate filter, NOx trap, and/or the catalytic converter via an automated fluid storage and injection system. Precisely timed DEF injections elevate the temperature of the various filtration elements and allow them to perform more efficiently. Introducing DEF into the catalyst system promotes filtration element longevity and allows fewer harmful exhaust emissions to be released into the atmosphere.","The EAS and catalyst systems are monitored and controlled by either the PCM or a stand-alone controller (which interacts with the PCM). The controller monitors the reductant fluid injection system pressure, O2, NOx, and exhaust temperature sensors (as well as other inputs) to determine the appropriate time for DEF (reductant) injection.","If the PCM detects excess voltage on the control circuit for the EAS fuel pump, a code P20DA will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated."],"symptoms":["Diminished engine performance\nExcessive black smoke from vehicle exhaust\nReduction in fuel efficiency\nOther EAS/SCR related codes"],"causes":["Bad EAS fuel supply pump\nDefective EAS fuel pressure sensor\nOpen or shorted wiring in the EAS fuel supply control circuit\nInsufficient DEF in the EAS reservoir\nBad EAS controller/PCM or programming error"]}
