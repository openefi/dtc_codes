{"code":"P2007","description":"Intake Manifold Runner Control Stuck Closed Bank 2","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code, which means that it applies to all 1996-newer vehicles (Nissan, Honda, Infiniti, Ford, Dodge, Acura, Toyota, etc.). Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model.","If your OBD II equipped vehicle has stored a code P2007, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected that the intake manifold air control (IMRC) actuator for engine bank two is stuck in the closed position. Bank 2 indicates that the malfunction is related to the bank of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.","\n ","The PCM controls the IMRC system, which is used to manage and fine tune air flow as it enters the lower intake manifold, cylinder heads, and the combustion chambers. Carefully shaped metal flaps, which fit snugly into the intake port of each cylinder, are opened and closed by an electronic runner control solenoid. The runner flaps are bolted to a thin metal rod that extends the length of each cylinder head and passes through the center of each intake port. The flaps are opened with one motion but this also means that all of the flaps will be inoperative if one of them is stuck or binding. The IMRC actuator is usually attached to the rod using a mechanical arm or a gear. A vacuum diaphragm is used on some models to operate the actuator. With the vacuum operated actuator, the PCM controls an electronic solenoid that regulates intake vacuum to the IMRC actuator.","Channeling and restricting the air flow, as it is drawn into the engine creates a swirling effect. Research data has shown us that the swirling effect helps the air/fuel mixture to be atomized more thoroughly. More complete atomization helps to reduce exhaust emissions, improve fuel efficiency, and optimize engine performance.","Different manufacturers use varying IMRC methods. Consult your vehicle information source (All Data DIY is an excellent resource) for the details of the IMRC system with which the vehicle in question is equipped. Typically, the IMRC runners are somewhat closed during starting/idling situations and opened completely when the throttle plate is opened.","In order to ensure that the IMRC system is functioning properly, the PCM monitors input signals from the IMRC runner position sensor, manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, manifold air temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, throttle position sensor, the oxygen sensors, and mass airflow (MAF) sensor (among others).","The PCM monitors actual runner flap position and adjusts it according to engine drivability data as it is input to the PCM and computed. A code P2007 will be stored, and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated, if the PCM doesn’t see a sufficient change in MAP or manifold air temperature as expected with the desired repositioning of the flaps (by the IMRC actuator). In some models, multiple ignition cycles with an IMRC actuator failure, will be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Hesitation upon acceleration\nRich exhaust\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nEngine surge"],"causes":["Possible causes for this engine code include:","Loose or binding intake manifold runners bank 2\nDefective IMRC actuator solenoid bank 2\nBad intake manifold runner position sensor bank 2\nOpen or shorted wiring in the IMRC actuator solenoid control circuit\nCarbon buildup on the IMRC flaps or intake manifold ports\nFaulty MAP Sensor\nCorroded IMRC actuator solenoid connector face"]}
