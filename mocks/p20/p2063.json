{"code":"P2063","description":"Reductant/Regeneration Supply Control Circuit Low","info":["This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is a generic powertrain code and applies to many OBD-II vehicles (1996-newer). That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Mercedes Benz, BMW, Dodge, Volkswagen, Ram, Sprinter, Audi, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","\nÂ ","A stored code P2063 means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an insufficient degree of voltage in the control circuit for the reductant/regeneration supply pump.","Selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems inject a reductant compound or diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) into the exhaust in front of the diesel particulate filter, NOx trap, and/or the catalytic converter via the reductant injection valve (solenoid). The precisely timed DEF injection elevates the temperature of the filtration element and allows it to perform more efficiently. It enhances filtration element longevity and allows fewer harmful exhaust emissions to be released into the atmosphere. The entire SCR system is monitored and controlled by either the PCM or a stand-alone controller (which interacts with the PCM). Either way, the controller monitors the O2, NOx, and exhaust temperature sensors (as well as other inputs) to determine the appropriate time for DEF (reductant) injection. Precise DEF injection is necessary to maintain exhaust temperature within acceptable parameters and optimize pollutant filtration.","The reductant/regeneration supply pump is used to pressurize the DEF in the liquid reductant system for use, when required. Supply pump voltage is monitored by the PCM for consistent fluctuation and load percentage. The PCM also monitors one or more pressure sensors in the reductant supply system to determine if there is a leak in the system.","If the PCM detects a degree of voltage in the reductant/regeneration supply pump control circuit that is less than the allowable parameters, a code P2063 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles - with a failure - may be required for MIL illumination."],"symptoms":["Reduction in fuel efficiency\nExcessive black smoke from vehicle exhaust\nDiminished engine performance\nOther SCR related codes"],"causes":["Defective reductant supply pump (overload)\nOpen or shorted circuits in the reductant supply control\nBad SCR controller/PCM or programming error"]}
