{"code":"P0521","description":"Engine Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch Range/Performance","info":["The vehicle's main computer called the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is in control of many sensors, controls, and electronics in the vehicle. One of the sensors called the oil pressure sensor or sender detects the amount of (mechanical) oil pressure in the engine and relays that in the form of a voltage reading/value to the PCM. In some vehicles, that oil pressure value is then relayed to a gauge in the instrument cluster to show the driver the oil pressure, other times that gauge is not there but there will be a warning light if there is a problem.","\nÂ ","This specific P0521 engine code is triggered when the PCM sees an unexpected value in the engine oil pressure sender/sensor. It could be out of it's normal range or could be fixed when it should fluctuate. For this P0521 trouble code, the cause may be mechanical or electrical, but is more than likely electrical related. This code is related to P0520, P0522, P0523, and P0524.","NOTE: This code is severe, if you have oil pressure issues with your engine, it could result in major damage, get your vehicle checked ASAP."],"symptoms":["Oil pressure gauge reading low or high\nOil pressure indicator lamp illuminated"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0521 code include:","Low oil level in the engine\nOld dirty oil (overdue for an oil change)\nLow oil pressure\nFaulty wiring or connection/connector in the oil pressure sender circuit\nFaulty oil pressure sender/sensor"],"type":"ERR"}
