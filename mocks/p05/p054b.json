{"code":"P054B","description":"Cold Start B Camshaft Position Timing Over-Retarded Bank 1","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. Vehicle makes may include but aren't limited to VW, Audi, Ford, Nissan, Hyundai, BMW, Mini, Mercedes-Benz, Jeep, etc.","\nÂ ","The ECM (Engine Control Module) is an extremely able computer that manages and monitors the vehicle's engine ignition system, mechanical positioning of the rotating assemblies, fuel injection, emission systems, exhaust, transmission, among countless other systems.","Another system the ECM is required to monitor and adjust accordingly is, the variable valve timing (VVT) system. Basically, this systems allows the ECM to monitor the mechanical timing between the camshaft and the crankshaft. This increases general efficiency in the operation of the engine. Not to mention, the fuel economy benefits. Truth is, your engine's ideal timing would adjust according to varying conditions. For this reason, they've designed the VVT system.","P054B (Cold Start B Camshaft Position Timing Over-Retarded Bank 1) is a code that alerts the operator that the ECM monitored an \"overly\"- retarded VVT position for camshaft timing on bank 1. Normally due to cold start up. The failure of this VVT self-test stems from the exceeded minimum calibration of the camshaft timing or it remains in an retarded position. Bank 1 is the side of the engine that contains the #1 cylinder.","Note: The \"B\" camshaft is either the exhaust, right, or left camshaft. Left/Right and Front/Rear are determined as though you are sitting in the driver's seat."],"symptoms":["Poor engine performance\nDecreased fuel economy\nPossible misfire on start-up\nCold start issues"],"causes":["The crankshaft position sensor is faulty\nThe camshaft position sensor is damaged\nThe intake valve timing control solenoid valve is defective\nThe intake valve timing intermediate lock control solenoid valve is flawed\nThe signal pick-up portion of the camshaft has accumulated debris\nThe timing chain is incorrectly installed\nForeign matter contaminates the oil groove for intake valve timing control"],"type":"ERR"}
