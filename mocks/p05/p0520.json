{"code":"P0520","description":"Engine Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch Circuit","info":["The vehicle's main computer called the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is in control of many sensors, controls, and electronics in the vehicle. One of the sensors called the oil pressure sensor or sender detects the amount of (mechanical) oil pressure in the engine and relays that in the form of a voltage reading/value to the PCM. In some vehicles, that oil pressure value is then relayed to a gauge in the instrument cluster to show the driver the oil pressure, other times that gauge is not there but there will be a warning light if there is a problem.","\nÂ ","This specific P0520 diagnostic engine code is triggered when the PCM sees a value from the engine oil pressure sender that is out of it's normal range. For this P0520 trouble code, the cause is most likely electrical related. This code is related to P0521, P0522, P0523, and P0524."],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illuminated (a.k.a. Check Engine Light)\nOil pressure gauge reading low or high\nOil pressure indicator lamp illuminated"],"causes":["Potential causes of a P0520 code include:","Faulty engine oil pressure sensor\nExcessive resistance in the oil pressure sensor circuit\nShort in the circuit to/from the oil pressure sensor and/or PCM and/or ground\nFaulty PCM (less likely)"],"type":"ERR"}
