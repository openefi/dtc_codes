{"code":"P0506","description":"Idle Air Control (IAC) System RPM Lower Than Expected","info":["This P0506 code is one that's sometimes triggered on vehicles that have electronic throttle control. That is, they don't have a regular throttle cable from the accelerator pedal to the engine. They rely on sensors and electronics to control the throttle.","\nÂ ","In this case, the P0506 DTC (diagnostic trouble code) is triggered when the PCM (powertrain control module) detects an engine idle speed that is lower than the desired (pre-programmed) RPM."],"symptoms":["Most likely the only thing you'll notice is the idle speed is lower than normal so it will likely be rougher. There are potentially other symptoms as well. Of course, when trouble codes are set, the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) illuminates."],"causes":["A P0506 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:","A vacuum leak\nAn air restriction in the intake air path or exhuast\nA faulty positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve\nDamaged/failed/dirty throttle body\nInternal engine problem\nFailed PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
