{"code":"P0557","description":"Brake Booster Pressure Sensor Circuit Low","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and applies to OBD-II vehicles that have a brake booster pressure sensor. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Nissan, Ford, Dodge, Pontiac, Chevrolet, Acura, Subaru, Hyundai, etc. Although generic, the exact repair steps may vary depending on year, make, model and powertrain configuration.","Trouble code P0557 is one of several possible codes associated to the Brake Booster Pressure Sensor Circuit.","\nÂ ","This code is an indication that the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) has detected a malfunction that is hindering the operation of the brake booster pressure sensor circuit. The codes that are commonly associated to brake booster pressure sensor circuit malfunctions are P0555, P0556, P0557, P0558 and P0559. The specific situation determines the code activated by the PCM and the brake warning light will be illuminated or flash when braking.","The purpose of the brake booster pressure sensor circuit is to monitor the amount of pressure (vacuum) applied to the power brake booster. The circuit is controlled by the PCM to adapt various braking situations and adjust the pressure to assist brake pedal operation. This process is essential for the power brakes to function properly and safely slow down or stop the vehicle with the minimum amount of foot pressure being applied to the brake pedal.","Code P0557 is set by the PCM when the brake booster pressure sensor circuit has low output voltage."],"symptoms":["Check Brake Light flashes when braking\nCheck Brake Light stays illuminated\nAn illuminated Service Engine Soon Light\nIncreased effort required to depress the brake pedal"],"causes":["Defective brake booster pressure sensor\nWorn or damaged vacuum lines\nCorroded or damaged connector\nDamaged or faulty wiring\nDefective brake booster\nDefective PCM"],"type":"WARN"}
