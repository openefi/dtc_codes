{"code":"P0554","description":"Power Steering Pressure Sensor Circuit Intermittent","info":["This generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) typically applies to all OBD-II vehicles equipped with a power steering pressure sensor. That may include but is not limited to vehicles from Infiniti, Nissan, Toyota, Lexus, Mazda, Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Kia, etc.","Before hydraulically and electrically assisted steering systems were invented, manufacturers used an unassisted rack and pinion steering system. This made steering at low speed extremely difficult and inefficient.","\nÂ ","For this reason we invented the power steering system. Generally speaking, a hydraulically assisted system will include a belt driven power steering pump, steering rack/box and various hoses/lines and sensors. The Engine Control Module (ECM) or Powertrain Control Module (PCM) works in conjunction with the power steering pressure sensor to monitor the pressure within the system and adjust accordingly.","The ECM illuminates the check engine light with P0554 and associated codes when it recognizes one or multiples condition outside a specific desired range within the power steering pressure sensors's circuit. Most times, I would say, this code is thrown by the ECM because of an electrical issue but at times, mechanical problems could possibly be the cause.","P0554 Power Steering Pressure Sensor Circuit Intermittent code is set when the ECM/PCM monitors an intermittent malfunction within the sensor's circuit. It is one of five related codes, which are P0550, P0551, P0552, P0553, and P0554."],"symptoms":["Erratic idle\nEngine stalling symptoms\nIntermittent assist when steering (choppy turning)\nHard to steer vehicle\nWhining noises\nLeaking fluid\nPoor handling"],"causes":["Broken or damaged wiring harness\nPower steering fluid leak\nFuse/relay defective\nPower steering pressure sensor defective\nECM issue\nPin/connector problem.
