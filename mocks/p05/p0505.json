{"code":"P0505","description":"IAC (Idle Air Control) System Malfunction","info":["The IAC (Idle Air Control) valve controls the idle speed of the engine. At idle the throttle plate is closed, of course. The IAC is computer controlled and allows only a certain amount of air around the throttle plate. This metered air controls the idle speed. The IAC has a \"plunger\" or \"shutter\" that moves to open or close the bypass air passageway.","\nÂ ","The more air the IAC allows around the throttle plate, the higher the idle. The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) uses the IAC valve to keep the idle speed correct with varying engine demands. Can be a three or four wire sensor depending on the model.","The PCM monitors voltages of the IAC circuits and if it detects an incorrect voltage on one or more of the IAC motor circuits it will set P0505. NOTE: Problems with the IAC would only be noticeable at idle or when throttle is closed."],"symptoms":["MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine stalls and may not idle unless throttle is depressed\nIntermittently stalls when letting off the throttle\nEngine may idle too high"],"causes":["Potential causes of an P0505 code include:","IAC motor connector is damaged (check connector and pins for damage, and moisture)\nOne or more IAC circuits open or shorted to ground\nOne or more IAC circuits are shorted to voltage\nIAC has failed\nPCM has failed"],"type":"ERR"}
