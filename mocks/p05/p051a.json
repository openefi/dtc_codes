{"code":"P051A","description":"Crankcase Pressure Sensor Circuit","info":["This is a generic powertrain diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and typically applies to OBD-II vehicles. Vehicle makes may include but aren't limited to Ford, Dodge, Ram, Jeep, Fiat, Nissan, etc.","Among the countless sensors the ECM (Engine Control Module) has to monitor and adjust in order to keep your engine in running order, the crankcase pressure sensor is responsible for providing the ECM with crankcase pressure values in order to maintain a healthy atmosphere in there.","\nÂ ","As you can imagine, there are an abundance of fumes within the engine internally, especially while its running so it is very important for the ECM to have an accurate crankcase pressure value. It needs this to not only ensure the pressure does not get too high and possibly cause damage to seals and gaskets, but also it requires this value in order to recycle these burnable fumes back into the engine via the PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system.","Any unused burnable crankcase fumes get routed into the intake for the engine to burn. In turn, collectively improving emissions and your fuel economy. That said, it definitely has a valuable purpose to the engine and ECM so make sure to address any issues accordingly here, as mentioned, with this fault, you may be susceptible to gasket failure, o-ring leaks, shaft seal leaks, etc. As the sensor's name implies, most times, it is mounted on the crankcase.","Code P051A Crankcase Pressure Sensor Circuit and related codes get activated by the ECM (Engine Control Module) when it monitor one or multiple electrical values operate outside the desire range within the crankcase pressure sensor circuit.","When your instrument cluster is illuminated with P051A Crankcase Pressure Sensor Circuit code, the ECM (Engine Control Module) has monitored a general fault within the crankcase pressure sensor circuit.","An example of a crankcase pressure sensor (this one for a Cummins engine):\n"],"symptoms":["Reduced fuel economy\nLeaking gaskets\nFuel smells\nCEL (Check Engine Light) illuminated\nEngine performing abnormally\nSludge in oil\nEngine smoking black soot\nHigh/Low internal crankcase pressures"],"causes":["Crankcase pressure sensor defective\nInternal electrical issue within the sensor\nECM issue\nPCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve defective\nPCV issue (broken runners/tubes, disconnected, chafed lines, etc.)\nClogged PCV system\nSludgy oil (moisture present)\nWater intrusion\nEngine over-filled with oil"],"type":"ERR"}
