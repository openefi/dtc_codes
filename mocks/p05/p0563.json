{"code":"P0563","description":"System Voltage High","info":["This generic powertrain/engine diagnostic trouble code typically applies to all 1996-newer vehicles, including but not limited to Kia, Hyundai, Jeep, Mercedes, Dodge, Ford and GM vehicles.","The PCM controls the charging system to a certain extent on these vehicles. The PCM can control the charging system by controlling a power or a ground circuit to the voltage regulator inside the alternator.","\n ","The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) monitors the ignition feed circuit to determine if the charging system is working. If the voltage is too high, a fault code will be set. This is strictly an electrical issue.","Troubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of charging system control and wire colors.\n"],"symptoms":["Malfunction Indicator Light On\nRed battery light On\nTransmission may not shift\nEngine may not start or if it does start, may stall out and die\nLower fuel economy"],"causes":["Potential causes for this code to set are:","High resistance in the cable between the alternator and battery - possible\nLow resistance/open circuit between the alternator and the control module - possible\nAlternator faulty – most common\nFailed PCM - unlikely"],"type":"WARN"}
